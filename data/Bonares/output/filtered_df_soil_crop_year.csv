To achieve a holistic understanding of responses to land management or climate change it is important, to jointly evaluate complex feedbacks among different variables across spatio-temporal scales, requiring different scientific disciplines – e.g., biogeochemistry, hydrology, socioeconomics - to work in concert. To do so, the holistic, automated experimental sensor platform AgroFlux aims to serve as multidisciplinary hub that integrate process-based knowledge over a wide range of spatio-temporal scales. In its current stage the AgroFlux experimental sensor platform features: 1) an automatized gantry crane robotic system to detect crop phenology (e.g., proximal sensing of spectral plant indices (NDVI, RVI) and IR canopy temperatures), GHG and ET flux dynamics (FT-NSS closed canopy chambers); 2) UAV based remote sensing for upscaling purposes; 3) flexible, adaptive measurement infrastructure (e.g., IoT sensor network, canopy chambers, proximal sensors for NDVI, RVI; IR canopy temperatures); 4) in-situ stable isotope (C, N and water) monitoring along soil-plant atmosphere gradients (flux separation); and 5) experiment based determination of processes within soil-plant atmosphere interphase (e.g., plant-soil feedbacks).","Soil, greenhouse gases, sensors, stable isotopes, appropriate technology, water-use efficiency, nitrogen-use efficiency, carbon sequestration, opendata, low-cost measurement equipment, Sensor Platform, GHG fluxes, spectral plant indices, Boden, Germany, Brandenburg, Uckermark, Focus Area Quillow, Site Research Station Dedelow",2025-01-08,Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research,English,True
03b52930-0210-4bfc-a4ac-75f7544ce7a5,50 years box plot experiment in Grossbeeren (1972 - 2022) - Plots,50 years box plot experiment in Grossbeeren (1972 - 2022) - Plots.,"The Box Plot Experiment in Grossbeeren was set up in 1972 to investigate the effect of different fertilization strategies within an irrigated vegetable crop rotation system for three different soils. Therefore, this vegetable long-term fertilization experiment can be used to investigate different plant-soil-systems under the same climatic conditions. The experimented was halted in 2022. The experimental site (52°21’01.30’’ E, 13°19’05.47’’ N, 50 m a.s.l.) is located in the transition zone between the more maritime-affected Northern German Plain and the continental climate of the European mainland. Weather data were collected in an agrometeorological station close to the experimental area. The long-term means (1991-2020) for air temperature and annual precipitation are 9.7 °C and 492 mm. The single plots are quadratic concrete boxes with walls of 10 cm thickness, a surface area of 4 m2 and a depth of 75 cm. The upper 50 cm are filled with the tested soils; the lower 25 cm comprises a coarse-sandy drainage layer. The three soil types are Arenic Luvisol (weak loamy sand), Gleyic Fluvisol (heavy sandy loam) and Luvic-Phaeozem (medium clayey silt) according to the World Reference Base – WRB (and the Bodenkundliche Kartieranleitung – KA4). Within 10 rotations, the vegetable species white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata f. alba), carrot (Daucus carota L.), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), leek (Allium porrum L.) and celery (Apium graveolens L. var. rapaceum Mill.) were cultivated. No celery was cultivated during the first rotation. The experiment consists of 12 fertilization treatments in different combinations of mineral N fertilization and organic amendments and as quadruplicate for each of the three soils. The experimental set-up scheme can be found in the supplementary material. Mineral N fertilizer was applied as calcium ammonium nitrate. Mineral P and K fertilization was uniform for all treatments. Total N and total C in soil, plant and organic amendments were determined using a CNS analyser VARIO El (Elemental Hanau) since 1995 and before by wet combustion with K2Cr2O7 und H2SO4. C and N in the soil samples and N in the plant samples were analysed annually. The C contents of the crop residues (leaf + stalk + root) of the five vegetable species were investigated irregularly. In autumn, the soil was annually dug up to 20 cm by using a spade. Weeds were removed by a combination of mechanical (cultivator, rake or hoe) and chemical measures. Insect protection nets, insecticides or fungicides were used where necessary. Approximately 150 mm per year was additionally irrigated with a sprinkler system. More details about the experiment’s description can be found in the supplementary material. Description of table 1 Related datasets are listed in the metadata element 'Related Identifier'.

bfe4971d-4681-4c02-8543-58b87b16ee90,Datenspeicher Boden (Data storage soil) GEMDAT,Datenspeicher Boden (Data storage soil) GEMDAT     .,"The effective use of soil is becoming increasingly important as part of all measures to further intensify and specialize plant production. This places greater demands not only on soil science research, but also on the evaluation of the site-specific data material to obtain comprehensive information. In many cases, the procedures and methods used to date for evaluating local history data are too time-consuming and not complex enough. Valuable findings are forgotten or are stored in so-called data cemeteries. In the future, it must be possible to provide site-specific documents for planning and decision-making for the qualitative and quantitative assessment of soil properties and for determining the spatial distribution of site-specific resources more quickly. This task can also only be solved in soil science with the help of electronic (better automated) data processing (EDP). For this reason, an (automated) information system “soil parameters” is being set up, which is derived from the soil data memory. The abbreviation DABO is used as the abbreviation. DABO is divided into various subsystems. The “Municipalities” subsystem (DABO-GEMDAT) is already fully utilized. Data can also be retrieved from the subsystems “Profiles” (DABO-PRODAT) and “Regional types” (DABO-REGDAT; see section 5.4.2.); however, storage is continuing successively here. There are other data storage and information systems for the rational communication of scientific partial information in the field of plant production, each of which deals with specific issues and questions (DAWIP, DAVEP, DASKE, EDP fertilization system, etc.). They also include site parameters and can therefore also be used to identify and assess soils/sites. With the establishment of the DABO, a branch of science known as informatics is now also being developed in the field of soil science. Informatics is a discipline that deals with the laws of scientific information activity, its theory, methodology and organization, in order to make the efforts to solve scientific problems more effective. Within the framework of computer science, the structure and properties, rather than the specific content of factual information, are examined, with a particular focus on the use of modern computing technology. Informatics in the field of soil science (soil informatics) becomes effective through a more comprehensive and effective communication of soil science data with the help of EDP.

The main purpose of the survey was to analyse in how far businesses are engaged for nature conservation as well as the factors that influence their actions in this regard. Moreover, the survey investigated business perceptions regarding the concept of an online-marketplace for nature conservation credits. The datasets include information about company characteristics. The complete dataset (i.e. “dataset_complete”) contains information from 747 respondents that logged into the online survey system. Out of those, the first subset (i.e. “subset_1”) comprises the responses from 618 companies that provided sufficiently complete questionnaires, suitable for an analysis of drivers for corporate conservation commitments. Methods: The survey was conducted in 2019. It was realised through postal invitation letters and a self-administered online-survey. The survey targeted large and medium sized companies of the secondary and tertiary sectors in Germany, which were sampled through proportional stratified random sampling. The strata were based on company size (i.e. number of employees) and location (i.e. federal state).

It is characterized by several experimental cycles with different cropping system comparisons. Soil tillage is the consistent factor since the start of the experiment. Crop rotation and irrigation were adjusted according to the research questions. Cycle 1 (2000-2006) investigated the potential of reducing soil tillage by comparing two cropping systems, one with and one without ploughing with different crops per system. Cycle 2 (2007-2018) investigated the potential to produce arable crops for biomass by comparing eight cropping systems. The factors were crop rotation, i) sole cropped maize every year and ii) 4-year rotation with one crop per year with maize-winter rye/sorghum-winter triticale-alfalfa clover grass mixture (all harvested for green biomass); soil tillage (ploughing and no-tillage); irrigation (rainfed and irrigated). Cycle 3 (2019-2023) investigated the potential of diversification comparing 16 cropping systems. The factors were rotation with all crops present every year (fully phased) with i) sole cropped maize, ii) sole cropped soybean, iii) maize-soybean sequence, and iv) maize-soybean-wheat-alfalfa clover grass mixture sequence); soil tillage (ploughing and reduced tillage); irrigation (rainfed and irrigated). The experimental cycles can be analyzed separately for specific research questions and for calibrating/validating models, and the long term effects of soil tillage, rotation and irrigation can be analyzed.

The objective was to identify grain legume species and cultivars for designing novel cropping systems in north-eastern Germany. The data supports agronomic analyses, as well as dynamic simulation modelling and includes details on crop growth, soil characteristics and weather. In the first part of the experiment different species and cultivars and the effect of irrigation were compared in a split block design with four replicates and the factors species/cultivar and irrigation during five consecutive years (2017-2022). The treatments included eight to 18 species/cultivars depending on the year with soybean, narrow-leafed lupin, white lupin, yellow lupin, faba bean, chickpea, dry bean, lentil and summer barley. Buckwheat was cultivated as a reference crop. Soybean and lupin seeds were inoculated with HISTICK® soybean/lupin (BASF, Germany) and in the last year with LegumeFix. No fertilizers and conventional crop protection was applied. All lupin species were treated with a natural insecticide against the Sitona weevils. For technical reasons, treatment with this insecticide of field bean, soybean and buckwheat was also unavoidable in some years. Measurements included grain yield, one thousand seed weigh, macro nutrients (N, P, K) in the grain, and additional agronomic observations including number of plants and plant phenology. Irrigation water was applied with a sprinkler system using the Web-BEREST model (Mirschel et al., 2014) to determine the amounts and timing (data on the amounts and dates are provided). In the second part of the experiment, the pre-crop effect of the mentioned legumes and buckwheat was tested on the grain yield and nutrient content in the following winter wheat crop and on the nitrogen dynamics in the soil. Before winter (November/December) and in the subsequent spring (February/March), mineral nitrogen was measured in the soil at three depths (0-30 cm, 30-60 cm, and 60-90 cm) after the different pre-crops. Winter wheat was established following the different pre-crops with 4 replicates during six consecutive years (2018-2023) In the first three years (2018 -2020) with conventional fertilization and crop protection and in the remaining years (2021- 2023) with ecological management.

ZALF's agricultural landscape research questions related to grassland and peatland are comprehensively addressed here. </p> <h1>Main research tasks that are addressed in this focus area:</h1> <p>1. Acting as a coordinating body for scientific work in the field of fenland research or grassland and fenland ecology. Implementation of a long-term data collection program on landscape-relevant variables on typical grassland sites of the ZALF study area.<br/> 2. Supervision of a grassland long-term experiment and a groundwater lysimeter installation with 103 lysimeters and 15 different soil types of Northeast Germany for parameter quantification and validation for grassland and landscape models.<br/> 3. Collaboration on ecosystem-based landscape analysis and related research projects in close cooperation with all program areas and working groups of ZALF. Securing grassland-specific experimental and mapping work in the landscape.<br/> 4. Organizing large-scale landscape ecology experiments involving agricultural and processing enterprises with a focus on production ecology research, development and redesign of the cultivated landscape. Active participation in the establishment of new landscape laboratories of ZALF and contribution of existing knowledge and experience.</p> <p>The fenlands of the Rhin-Havelluch have essentially developed as marshy and silted-up fenland with waterlogging by groundwater. The 300 years of drainage in connection with intensive use in the past decades has contributed to a considerable extent to the fen shrinkage and mineralization of the organic soil substance. Therefore, the subject of research is particularly the protection of the fenland body and extensive agricultural land use practices that conserve abiotic and biotic resources.</p> <p>The soil physical and chemical parameters of the study area can be characterized as follows:&#xD; Soil physical parameters from the crumb horizon of the Rhin-Havelluch.<br/> Organic matter content (%): 65 - 70<br/> Solids (Vol.%): 19 - 27<br/> Usable water capacity (Vol.%): 42 - 48<br/> Minimum air capacity (Vol.%): 11 - 12<br/> Ca (%): 2.4 - 4.8<br/> K (%): 0,07 - 0,10<br/> P (%): 0,07 - 0,11<br/> N (%): in organic matter 4.2 - 4.3<br/> pH value: 5.8 - 7.2</p> <p> The long-term mean of precipitation (1981 - 2010) is 536 mm.

92fbdda0-8919-45bc-91af-ddcced734e6c,Effect of topsoil dilution on stabilization of plant derived carbon  (dataset),Effect of topsoil dilution on stabilization of plant derived carbon  (dataset).,"Tillage erosion, i.e. the incorporation of subsoil into topsoil, often occurs in hilly croplands but up to now effect of tillage erosion on the fate of plant material remains poorly understood. We conducted an incubation experiment comparing topsoil, diluted topsoil and subsoil from an erosion effected field site in Germany. 14CO2 respiration was traced over a period of 33 days after addition of 14C labelled plant residues and 14C incorporation into several C fractions was studied. Topsoil and diluted topsoil showed increased C turnover compared to subsoil. The addition of plant residues induced increased decomposition of native soil organic matter, resulting in a priming effect of similar magnitudes in all treatments. In terms of carbon fractionation, topsoil dilution primarily affected the POM and MAOM fractions, with a decline in the order of topsoil diluted subsoil. Plant derived C was preferentially stabilized in the MAOM fraction, especially in subsoils, indicating potential for C stabilization in these soils. Overall, we observed small effects of topsoil dilution on soil C storage. Further studies are needed to test the effectiveness of topsoil dilution for long-term C sequestration and to understand how the mineral composition of subsoils influences C storage after dilution.

The depth to which agricultural management practices affect SOM is uncertain. Soil depth can have an important influence on SOM dynamics, so it is important to consider depth effects to fully account for changes, particularly in soil organic C (SOC) stocks. This is particularly true when assessing C faming measures, which are becoming increasingly important due to climate change. We sampled and analysed the top metre of mineral arable soils from ten long-term experiments (LTEs) in Germany to quantify and qualify the depth-dependent effects on SOC stocks, C and nitrogen (N) content, the δ13C and δ15N signature and the C/N ratio of the soils due to common agricultural management practices: Mineral N fertilisation (only for SOC stocks), a combination of N, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilisation, irrigation, crop rotation with legumes, straw incorporation, farmyard manure (FYM) application, liming and reduced tillage. In addition, the effects of soil compaction (only for the SOC stocks) were analysed as a negative side-effect of agricultural management. The dataset includes metadata and research data on soil properties at 0-100 cm, e.g., mean annual temperature and precipitation, C and N content, SOC stocks, water content, texture data (sand, silt, clay), pH, δ13C and δ15N values.

The depth to which agricultural management practices affect SOM is uncertain. Soil depth can have an important influence on SOM dynamics, so it is important to consider depth effects to fully account for changes, particularly in soil organic C (SOC) stocks. This is particularly true when assessing C faming measures, which are becoming increasingly important due to climate change. We sampled and analysed the top metre of mineral arable soils from ten long-term experiments (LTEs) in Germany to quantify and qualify the depth-dependent effects on SOC stocks, C and nitrogen (N) content, the δ13C and δ15N signature and the C/N ratio of the soils due to common agricultural management practices: Mineral N fertilisation (only for SOC stocks), a combination of N, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilisation, irrigation, crop rotation with legumes, straw incorporation, farmyard manure (FYM) application, liming and reduced tillage. In addition, the effects of soil compaction (only for the SOC stocks) were analysed as a negative side-effect of agricultural management. The dataset includes metadata and research data on soil properties at 0-100 cm, e.g., mean annual temperature and precipitation, C and N content, SOC stocks, water content, texture data (sand, silt, clay), pH, δ13C and δ15N values.

To reduce the N losses in these cropping systems, implementation of high carbon amendments (HCA) is used. In this study, we investigate potential shifts in microbial abundance and community composition though HCA implementation in a 12- months field trail in an oilseed rape – winter wheat cropping system. We postulate that (i) bacterial and archaeal absolute abundance increase in HCA implemented plots. And we expected (ii) that changes in nutrient stoichiometry caused by the HCA implementation promotes the establishment of bacteria able to degrade complex C sources, such as Firmicutes and Acidobacteria and overall cause shifts in the microbial community composition to an increased number of taxa which are described with a copiotrophic lifestyle. A field-experiment in Dürnast (Germany) with a silty-loam soil was performed. Wheat straw was incorporated directly after harvest of oilseed rape in August 2022 and soil samples were collected from 0-10 cm after 6 (February 2023), 9 (May 2023), 11 (July 2023) and 12 (August 2023) months after implementation. We determined microbial carbon and microbial nitrogen contents by executing chloroform-fumigation and afterwards extracting the soil with 0.01 M CaCl2 solution. The copy numbers of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and archaeal 16S rRNA gene by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was quantified. Subsequently, 16S amplicon sequencing was performed for all samples and raw sequencing data is available at the sequencing read archive (SRA) under the BioProject ID PRJNA1128396 (SAMN42050636, SAMN42051589, SAMN42107788, SAMN42108963). Information of sequencing data is summarized in the excel file “sequencing Inplamint”. Our data indicate a slightly increase in microbial abundance as well as in microbial carbon in HCA treatment. This increase was not observed for microbial nitrogen. Our data also suggests a stronger influence of microbial community composition though HCA implementation in late winter/ early based on the results of the differential abundance analysis. Furthermore, microbial community in HCA treatment was driven in all four sampling points by the bacterial families Chitinophagaceae and BIrii41 (phylum Myxococcota) and the bacterial genera Pirellula.

All images were processed on the Google Earth Engine platform (https://code.earthengine.google.com). GEE is a scalable, cloud-based geospatial retrieval and processing platform that offers free in-cloud data access, processing, and administration. The MODIS product used for burned area assessment was from collection 6.1. The images of the burned area (MCD64A1) and active fire (MCD14DL and NRT) were computed from https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MCD64A1 and https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/FIRMS, In this study, over a 20-year study period (2003 to 2023), 252 images were processed at a rate of one image per month for the burned area through the GEE platform when setting up the code. Based on this information, a technique for processing, evaluating, and displaying geodata on forest fires and their consequences was created. The approach consists of four (4) main parts in this study, which are: acquiring and loading input data from publicly available geographic information web services (http://diva-gis.org/datadown)(Step1); pre-processing (filtering) of multi-channel satellite images, computation of indexed images (Step2); thresholding and saving the original data and outcomes in cloud storage (Step3) and then exportation in GIS for geoprocessing (Step3). At the end of the processing, the metadata is composed of data in shapefile format of the monthly and annual burnt areas over the period 2003-2023 as well as those of the active fires. All the data has been re-structured in an Excel file with the appropriate area and number of active points.

To allow the crops an easier access to deep soil layers a mechanical strip-wise subsoil loosing with the addition of biocompost (DLB treatment) was established in frame of Soil3 project (for further details: Schmittmann et al. 2021). In this study, the influence of subsoil management on microbial community composition was investigated 2020 in a field trail in Klein-Altendorf (Bonn), using the three different winter wheat genotypes Milaneco, Capo and Trebelir. Thereby, exhibit the genotypes Milaneco and Capo a more deep-rooting and the genotype Trebelir a shallower rooting system. We postulate, that (i) the absolute abundance of bacteria and archaea will be increased in DLB treatment plots. And we expected that (ii) that DLB treatment will create a shift in microbial community composition, especially in the subsoil layers. Soil and roots samples were taken from 0-30, 30-60 and 60-100 cm in June 2020, at flowering time of winter wheat, in three biological replicates. The soil type was classified as Haplic Luvisol (Hypereutric, Siltic) and is characterized by a silty clay loam texture with clay accumulation in the subsoil (between 45 and 95 cm soil depth). The copy numbers of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and archaeal 16S rRNA gene was quantified by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Subsequently, 16S amplicon sequencing was performed for all bulk soil and root samples and raw sequencing data is available at the sequencing read archive (SRA) under the BioProject PRJNA1129315 (SAMN42150195, SAMN42152877). Our data indicate a slightly increase in bacteria in soil samples among all genotypes and soil depths, this trend is not so evident for abundance of archaea in soil samples. For root samples an increase in bacterial and archaeal abundance was only observed for the genotype Capo, especially for the depths 0-30 and 30-60 cm. Alpha diversity was increased in the deep-rooting genotypes in root samples. In soil samples only for the genotype Milaneco a strong increase in alpha diversity was observed, especially in the samples from 30-60 cm. Furthermore, beta diversity for soil and root samples was only influenced by the different sampling depths but not by the genotype or the treatment. In addition, the shared ASVs representing the core microbiome, in soil and root samples, contain more shared ASVs between the genotypes per each depth in DLB treatment in comparison to control plots.

The soil is a loess chernozem over limestone with an effective rooting depth of 100 cm, containing 22% clay, 70% silt and 8% sand in the ploughed upper (Ap) horizon. It has a neutral pH (7.0–7.4) and an appropriate P and K supply (45–70 mg kg-1 and 130–185 mg kg-1 in calcium-acetate-lactate extract, respectively). The 1980–2010 annual average temperature was 9.7°C, and the average annual precipitation was 511 mm. On five large parcels in strip split plot design (1.2 ha each, main plots) the individual crops grain maize (Zea mays), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum), winter barley (Hordeum vulgare), winter rapeseed (Brassica napus ssp. napus), and winter wheat are rotated on the main plots and grown in parallel. All crop residues remain on the fields. Conservation tillage with a cultivator (CT; 10 cm flat non-inversion soil loosening) is compared to sub-plots with conventional tillage (MP; mould-board plough, carrier board with combined alternating ploughshares, ploughing depth 30 cm, incl. soil inversion). The differentially managed soils are either intensively (Int) operated according to usual practice regarding N supply and pesticide application or extensively managed (Ext) with reduced N supply, without fungicides, and growth regulators. The climate data are not included in the data set. They can be downloaded via the DWD's Open Data Server because there is a DWD weather station (ID 00445) in Bernburg-Strenzfeld.

Each site comprised a paired alley-cropping agroforestry system (AF) and an adjacent open cropland system (OC) serving as a reference land-use system without trees. At each agroforestry system, four subplots were arranged along linear transects orthogonal to the orientation of the tree rows, with a sampling point at the center of the tree row and at 1, 7, and 24 m (center of the crop row) distance from the tree row edge into the crop row. Open cropland systems had 4 subplots (sampling point) with a minimum distance of 25 m between each other and at least 30 m to the field margins. In total, 20 emergence traps (16 agroforestry, 4 open cropland) were set up at each site. Emergence traps consisted of a white gauze tent covering an area of 0.36 m2 (60 x 60 cm; height: 60 cm) with sides buried 10 cm deep to ensure no exchange between inside and outside. Inside the tents, a pitfall trap (95mm opening diameter, 639 ml volume) and a bottle at the top of the tent were filled with a 50/50 mixture of propylene glycol and water to catch arthropods. Traps were emptied from March to July 2022 monthly, yielding five trapping periods. Adult spiders were identified to species level. Research domain: Ecology of Agricultural Landscapes Research question: Do alley-cropping agroforestry systems provide more spider overwintering and emergence habitats than open cropland systems and therefore enable earlier build-up of predator communities?","Soil, opendata, Boden",2024-04-25,ZALF,English,True

Each site comprised of an alley-cropping agroforestry system (AF) and an adjacent open cropland system (OC) serving as a reference land-use system without trees. At each agroforestry system, three subplots were established and arranged along linear transects orthogonal to the orientation of the tree row, spanning from the edge of the tree row to the center of the crop row. Each subplot in the agroforestry systems contained a transect with sampling points at 1, 7, and 24 m (center of the crop row) distance from the tree row edge into the crop row. Open cropland systems had three subplots (sampling point) with a minimum distance of 25 m between each other and at least 30 m to the field margins. At each sampling point two different seed cards were laid out. One card with weed seeds (Avena fatua) and another one with crop seeds (Hordeum vulgare). In total, 12 seed cards (9 agroforestry, 3 open cropland) of each type were set up at each site. Seed cards were manufactured using conventional sand paper (grain-size 400), labeled on the smooth side. The rough side was covered with repositionable spray adhesive (3M spray mount, art. no. 6065) and 10 seeds of the respective species were positioned in the middle of the cards. The glue was left to dry and covered with sand to avoid arthropods getting stuck on remaining glue. Seeds, which were lost before exposure were counted and excluded from evaluation. Seed cards were exposed for 48h in May and five weeks later (35 days) in June. After exposure, seed cards were evaluated on site by counting remaining seeds.

Each site comprised of an alley-cropping agroforestry system (AF) and an adjacent open cropland system (OC) serving as a reference land-use system without trees. At each agroforestry system, three subplots were established and arranged along linear transects orthogonal to the orientation of the tree row, spanning from the edge of the tree row to the center of the crop row. Each subplot in the agroforestry systems contained a transect with sampling points at 1, 7, and 24 m (center of the crop row) distance from the tree row edge into the crop row. Open cropland systems had three subplots (sampling point) with a minimum distance of 25 m between each other and at least 30 m to the field margins. At each sampling point two aphid cards were laid out. In total, 24 aphid cards (18 agroforestry, 6 open cropland) were set up at each site. Aphid cards were manufactured using conventional sand paper (grain-size 400) folded up like a gable. On one of the rough interior sides six glue dots (UHU, Max Repair; Universal) were placed with a distance of 1 cm to each other. After placing adult black bean aphids (Aphis fabae) alive on the glue dots, aphid cards were immediately frozen at -20°C. Aphids, which were lost before exposure were counted and excluded from evaluation. Aphid cards were exposed for 48h in May and five weeks later (35 days) in June. After exposure, aphid cards were evaluated under the microscope regarding the type of damage they received (abducted, chewing marks).

With the help of mobile proximal soil sensors, the lime-relevant soil parameters pH value, texture and soil organic matter were recorded time-saving, cost-effectively and on a small scale. Regulations for processing the sensor data and deriving fertilization recommendations were developed. An important sub-step in determining the lime requirement is the site-specific calibration of the sensor data in order to obtain high-resolution maps of the lime-relevant soil parameters. For this purpose, soil samples were taken from all mapped plots and analyzed for pH, soil organic carbon and grain size distribution. The analyzed results of the first out of three participating farms in the project are available in this data set. Furthermore, in addition to the analysis of the pH value, a basic soil investigation was carried out determining the plant-availability of phosphorus, potassium and magnesium. To date, the dataset consists of a total of 599 entries for pH, 508 for soil organic carbon, total carbon and total nitrogen content, 581 for P, K and Mg, and 374 for soil texture (clay, fine silt, medium silt, coarse silt, fine sand, medium sand, coarse sand).

After all wild bees were identified to species level, from a subset of samples we measured the Intertegular distance ITD (distance between the wings) as body size and searched for functional traits regarding sociality (solitary, eusocial, parasitic) nesting type (below- or aboveground), and lecty (poly- or oligolectic). In addition, biotic and abiotic characteristics of these kettle holes were recorded to evaluate how they affect wild bee diversity. These factors included size of the kettle hole, the degree of isolation (number of neighboring kettle holes at different distances), percentage of flowering species and total of plant species (herbs and woody plants). We tested the effect of all these factors on wild bee abundance and bee species richness, as well on body size and functional traits. - Applied Methods for sampling and identification: Collection of individuals using colour traps. One trap had 6 coloured plastic containers (white, blue and yellow) placed in three levels randomly. Water with some drops of soap was added to each container and traps were place in each kettle hole during 48 hours. A total of 4 traps were set up in each kettle hole and a total of 36 kettle holes were studied. After 2 days insects trapped in the water were collected without differentiating the colour of the plastic container. Bee individuals were separated and taken to the lab for further preparation and identification. - Bee specimens were pinned and dried at room temperature. Individuals were identified until species level by specialists K. Rupik from Bielefeld University and C. Saure at the Natural History Museum in Berlin. Information about functional traits regarding sociality, lecty and nesting were compiled from the literature with the final list of species. Body size was characterized as intertegular distance (distance between wings) measured in a subset of randomly selected individuals per species.

The selection of the variety should also be adapted accordingly to the location. For this purpose, the influence of catch crop treatments (without catch crop, clover, TerraLife mixture) on the following crop (maize) with regard to microbial phosphorus mobilization in the rhizosphere, arbuscular mycorrhization and phosphorus availability in the soil was investigated in the long term field trial in Asendorf in the humus-consuming crop rotation in the 2021/2022 growing season.","Soil, phosphorus, mycorrhizae, catch crops, maize, soil, plant available phosphorus, microorganisms, opendata; microbial ressource; Soil; Agricultural and aquaculture facilities, Boden, mycorrhiza, soil, soil biology, phosphorus",2024-07-18,ZALF,English,True
4a82859d-7e04-412c-92f8-ed7cf7ca9d2f,Amorphous silica reduces N2O emissions from arable land at the field plot scale (dataset),Amorphous silica reduces N2O emissions from arable land at the field plot scale (dataset).,"Increasing greenhouse gas emissions pose a strong threat due to accelerating global warming. N2O emissions are highly important in this regard as N2O is a very powerful greenhouse gas. Agriculture is the main human-induced source for N2O emissions contributing roughly 60% to total N2O emissions. Soil amorphous silica (ASi) contents are reduced in arable soils due to yearly exports by crop harvest as most crops are silicon accumulator plants. Most recently it has been shown that ASi is increasing water and nutrient availability in soils. Both factors are known to directly and indirectly affect N2O emissions from agroecosystems. This dataset originates from a study which we conducted at a field plot trial on arable soil depleted in ASi and fertilized this soil its pre-agricultural ASi level. The data shows that increasing soil ASi to a pre-agricultural level decreased seasonal N2O emissions by ~30%. This reduction of N2O emissions due to ASi might be of global relevance as agricultural practice has reduced the ASi content in agricultural soils. If future studies confirm the effect of ASi on N2O emissions, the soil ASi depletion by agricultural practice in the last decades may have led to a substantial increases of N2O emissions.

This, together with an increasing demand for fertilizer and pesticide reduction has led to consider different and new approaches. We investigate the effect of Hartmannibacter diazotrophicus strain E19, a plant growth promoting rhizobacterium, in order to enhance the production of wheat and barley under low energy input. For that, we analyze the effect of three factors: organic fertilizer (with and without, only wheat), row distance (15 cm and 50 cm), and bacterial inoculation (E19 and control) at two different organic experimental field stations (Gladbacherhof and Kleinhohenheim). The dataset provides information about different parameter determined from rhizosphere soil and root samples collected at two different developmental stages (flowering and milk/fully ripe), as well as, the grain yield, straw yield, 1000 kernel mass, and seed quality during the seasons 2020-2021 and 2021-2022. The following soil parameter were evaluated: ammonium, nitrate, carbon-nitrogen ratio, microbial biomass, the respiration activity using different carbon sources (glucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, arginine). These data sets are currently under evaluation and complemented with the quantification from root samples through quantitative PCR (qPCR) of strain E19 and the metabarcoding sequencing of the bacterial communities based on 16S rRNA genes obtained from rhizosphere soil samples during the two seasons.

This makes it all the more important in the future to use the natural microbiome of the soil effectively, especially against the backdrop of the increasing problems of global warming and resource consumption. Symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi is a tool that is used by countless plants to support the supply of nutrients or counteract drought stress. It can be assumed that different varieties have different tendencies to interact with the microbiome. The aim is therefore to gain insights into whether the choice of variety at a location allows a statement to be made about the mycorrhizal tendency and whether this consequently influences the phosphorus nutrient status in the soil and plant. To this end, two different maize varieties were investigated in a two-year trial (2021 and 2022) on a permanent trial site in Rostock under four fertilization regimes with regard to their mycorrhizal propensity and microbial phosphorus mobilization and availability. Research domain: Soil Sciences Research question: It was investigated to what extend the tendency/abundance of mycorrhizal fungi formation on maize is influenced by the choice of crop variety and whether it affects the phosphorus nutrient supply in the soil and plant.","Soil, phosphorus, mycorrhizae, maize, soil, plant available phosphorus, microorganisms, opendata; microbial ressource; Agricultural and aquaculture facilities, Boden, mycorrhiza, soil, soil biology, phosphorus, Soil",2024-07-18,ZALF,English,True

85040363-b699-4af0-9355-e47d2ebeee1b,Effect of topsoil dilution and digestate application on CO2 and N2O emissions from erosion affected soils,Effect of topsoil dilution and digestate application on CO2 and N2O emissions from erosion affected soils.,"Meliorative, partial deep tillage (PDT) has a high potential for a permanent increase in the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks. Through PDT, the lower-concentration, C and N-poor subsoil is tilled upwards towards the surface, the topsoil material is buried in the subsoil and simultaneously mixed, resulting in a C and N dilution of the topsoil. However, whether this might temporarily enhance the C and N accumulation until the former equilibrium of a diluted topsoil is reached is yet unclear. To clarify this, we conducted a model experiment simulating subsoil mixing into topsoil and analysed CO2 and N2O emissions, considering soil type, erosion state and digestate application. We used a non-eroded Albic Luvisol (LL), eroded Albic Luvisol (eLL), and a strongly eroded Calcaric Regosol (RZ) soils from the CarboZALF experimental area in the Uckermark, Germany. Each soil's topsoil was mixed with 20% material from the respective subsoil and incubated for 26 days in an automated, gas exchange measuring system. Undiluted, unfertilised substrates served as controls, and were compared with those receiving organic fertiliser (Digestate). Digestate addition uniformly increased CO2 emissions across all soil types and notably elevated N2O emissions, particularly in eLL soil. A moderate increase in RZ and the smallest increase in LL soil were observed. Topsoil dilution reduced CO2 release in all variants, especially in fertilised variants, but only moderately reduced N2O emissions in eLL soil upon subsoil and digestate addition. Conversely, slight increases in N2O release were observed in the other two soils under these conditions. Research domain: Soil Sciences Research question: We pursued the following hypotheses: the addition of digestate always leads to a short-term increase in CO2 and N2O release; soil dilution leads to a significant reduction in CO2 and N2O release because the available C and N quantities are reduced in the diluted and undersaturated topsoil or a higher proportion of the C and N from the digestate is bound in the soil; and the effect of soil dilution and digestate is somewhat modified by the degree of erosion of the soil.","Soil, erosion, greenhouse gases, deep tillage, carbon sequestration, nitrogen cycle, opendata, Boden, Germany, Brandenburg, Uckermark, Quillow, Dedelow",2024-05-28,Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research,English,True

Understanding these responses is hence essential for developing sustainable agriculture systems that can help to adapt to global challenges such as inter-alia increased drought. Typically, an initial understanding of GHG and water flux dynamics is gained through laboratory or greenhouse pot experiments, where gas exchange is often measured using commercially available, manual closed (leaf) chamber systems. However, these systems are usually rather expensive and often labor-intensive, thus limiting the number of different treatments that can be studied and their repetitions. Here, we present a fully automatic, low-cost (1.000 Euro), multi-chamber system based on Arduino, termed “greenhouse coffins”. It is designed to continuously measure canopy CO2 and ET fluxes. And it can operate in two modes: an independent and a dependent measurement mode. The independent measurement mode utilizes low-cost NDIR CO2 (K30 FR) and relative humidity (SHT31) sensors, thus making each “greenhouse coffin” a fully independent measurement device. The dependent measurement mode connects multiple “greenhouse coffins” via a low-cost multiplexer ( 250 Euro) to a single infrared gas analyzer (LI-850, LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, USA), allowing for measurements in series, achieving cost efficiency, while also gaining more flexibility in terms of target GHG fluxes (potential extension to N2O, CH4, stable isotopes). In both modes, CO2 and ET fluxes are determined through the respective concentration increase during closure time. We tested both modes and demonstrated that the presented system is able to deliver precise and accurate CO2 and ET flux measurements using low-cost sensors, with an emphasis on calibrating the sensors to improve measurement precision. Through connecting multiple greenhouse coffins via our low-cost Multiplexer to a single infrared gas analyzer in the dependent mode, we could show moreover that the system can efficiently measure CO2 and ET fluxes in a high temporal resolution across various treatments with both labor and cost efficiency. Therefore, the developed system offers a valuable tool for conducting greenhouse experiments, enabling comprehensive testing of plants' dynamic responses to various treatments and conditions.

A field experiment was established and measurements performed from November 2022 to March 2023 at Koussin lélé, Cove district, using a split-plot experimental design. The main plot was assigned to water management technologies that included continuous flooding and two thresholds of periodic drying irrigation to 15 cm and 25 cm soil depth. The subplot was assigned to the nitrogen fertilizer regime which includes 90 kg ha-1 (farmer’s practice) and 120 kg ha-1 (enhanced amount of fertilizer). Based on biweekly conducted manual closed chamber (A: 0.16m2; V:0.16m3) measurements of evapotranspiration (ET) and CO2 exchange (ecosystem respiration (Reco) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE)), the seasonal dynamics in WUE were assessed as canopy (cWUE) and ecosystem water use efficiency (eWUE), respectively. Canopy gas exchange measurements were performed using a novel, low-cost ET and CO2 flux logger system (Macagga et al. 2024; RelatedIdentifier TAB1). Measured CO2 and ET fluxes were calculated using a modular R script described in detail by Hoffmann et al. (2015; Reco/NEE; RelatedIdentifier TAB2) and Dahlmann et al. (2022; ET; RelatedIdentifier TAB3). In addition to cWUE and eWUE, the crop season WUE was calculated as grain (gWUE) and biomass water use efficiency (bWUE). Results showed that the maximum grain yield (6.19 Mg ha-1) was observed for the continuous flooding rice cultivation receiving 120 Kg N ha-1 even though it was only 6.9 % higher than the yield recorded for the periodic drying at -15cm. The cWUE and eWUE followed the same pattern but were generally higher for periodic drying at -15cm under N90 with 2.63 g C (Kg H2O)-1 d-1 and 1.25 g C (Kg H2O)-1 d-1 respectively. Furthermore, this particular treatment also recorded the highest values for all the cumulative WUE parameters. Our findings emphasize the adoption of the periodic drying irrigation regime with an application rate of N90 Kg. ha-1 for more sustainable irrigated rice production.

This form of utilization is suspected of promoting the CO2 source function through the increased depletion of soil carbon stocks. There is a particular need for action regarding the reduction of negative climate and environmental impacts when applying digestate. Various factors suggest that these problems can be addressed using the well-known technique of partial subsoil tillage. Unlike traditional subsoil tillage, the risk of subsequent yield losses, subsoil compaction, and increased energy expenditures is low here. This is because, in partial subsoil tillage (pST), a controlled mixing of carbon-poor subsoil into the plow layer and the transfer of topsoil into well-rooted shafts in the subsoil are combined. In the topsoil, imbalances in the carbon and nitrogen dynamics are created, which should lead to a rapid rebuild of organic matter stocks and thus to CO2-C sequestration and nitrogen fixation. At the same time, organic carbon located in the subsoil after pST should be protected from rapid decomposition. The overall goal of the project is to determine whether pST actually has the mentioned effects and whether it can be optimized through an interdisciplinary research approach to achieve a lasting reduction in the climate and environmental impact of raw material crop production in agricultural practice.","Soil, opendata, Boden, Germany, Brandenburg, Uckermark, Quillow, Dedelow",2024-05-15,Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research,English,True

While its impact on soil C cycling has been widely recognized, there are few information about its impact on soil N cycling and N fertilizer dynamics. Here, we studied three factors potentially influencing N cycling and N fertilizer dynamics in cropping systems, namely: 1.) soil type, 2.) erosion-induced topsoil dilution and 3.) N fertilizer form in a full-factorial pot experiment using canola plants. We studied three erosion affected soil types (Luvisol, eroded Luvisol, calcaric Regosol) and performed topsoil dilution in all three soils by admixing 20% of the respective subsoil into its topsoil. N fertilizer dynamics was investigated using either mineral (calcium ammonium nitrate) and organic (biogas digestate) fertilizer, labeled with 15N. The fertilizer 15N recovery and the distribution of the fertilizer N in different soil fractions was quantified after plant maturity. Fertilizer N dynamics and utilization were influenced by all three factors investigated. 15N recovery in the plant-soil system was higher and fertilizer N utilization was lower in the treatments with diluted topsoil than in the non-diluted controls. Similarly, plants of the organic fertilizer N treatments took up significantly less fertilizer N in comparison to mineral fertilizer treatments. Both, topsoil dilution and organic fertilizer application promoted 15N recovery and N accumulation in the soil fractions, with strong differences between soil types. Our study reveals a noteworthy insight: topsoil dilution due to soil erosion has a negligible impact on N cycling and dynamics in the plant-soil system. The crucial factors influencing these processes are found to be the choice of fertilizer form and the specific soil type. Recognizing these aspects is essential for a precise and comprehensive assessment of the environmental continuum, emphasizing the novelty of our findings.

Especially under wet soil conditions, when soil is susceptible to compaction, heavy wheel load field traffic can lead to harmful soil compaction. This data set contains soil data from a wheeling experiment with agricultural vehicles from the silage maize harvest chain (maize chopper (total weight: 20 t), tractor with mulcher (total weight: 75 t), and tractor with silage trailer (total weight: 32 t)). The experiment was conducted in 2016 on an agricultural test field in Adenstedt (Hildesheim district, Lower Saxony, Germany). The soil type is Stagnic Luvisol derived from Loess and was tilled with a cultivator up to a depth of 25 cm (reduced tillage). For the wheeling experiment, the harvest chain vehicles passed defined plots in the inner field area one after another (8 wheel passes). Maximum soil pressure und plastic soil deformation evoked by vehicle passing was measured simultaneously with a multi-channel device consisting of Bolling probes (Bolling, 1987) and hydrostatic measuring hoses (Nolting et al., 2006). Maximum soil pressure and plastic soil deformation was measured in 20, 35, and 50 cm depth directly below the center of the tires. To investigate changes in soil physical parameters, soil structure, and soil functions caused by harvest chain vehicles driving, undisturbed soil cores (100 cm³) were taken before (unwheeled) and after wheeling (wheeled). The sampling sites were located in the inner field area. Two soil pits were sampled per wheeling variant. A total of 30 undisturbed soil samples were taken per each soil pit, 10 per each soil depth (20, 35, 50 cm). The soil biopores were counted in every one of the three soil depths. 5 of the 10 undisturbed sampling rings were used to investigate soil water retention and the other 5 for saturated hydraulic conductivity. The determination of pF values was conducted in the soil laboratory using sand and clay boxes as well as pressure pots according to DIN ISO 11274.

The impact of location clearly surpassed the influence of biopores on P mobilization. In the subsoil was a partially increased P mobilization and a minor increased P availability present while in the top soil proved almost no significant effects on the P cycle.

Alp with mean temperature 7.5°C and annual precipitation 1042 mm. In each region, measurements were conducted over a time period of nine cropping seasons from 2009 to 2018. The backbone of the investigation was formed by six eddy-covariance stations (EC) which measured fluxes of water, energy and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere at half hourly resolution. This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes. Moreover, more than 1,200 soil samples were taken to study changes of carbon and nitrogen contents. One station in each region has now been set up as continuous observatories of state variables and fluxes in intensively managed agricultural fields.

By sequential fractionation and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy we investigated whether and how the chemical composition of bone char particles has been altered in soil and, consequently, has affected the P speciation of amended soils. Therefore, two different kinds of bone char particles (BC, produced by pyrolysis of degreased animal bone chips at 800 ºC and BCplus, a BC enriched with reduced sulfur compounds) were manually separated from the soil at the end of two different experiments: “incubation-leaching” and “ryegrass cultivation”. Sequential P-fractionation of amended soils showed P-enrichment in all fractions as compared to the control. The most P increase between all treatments significantly occurred in the NaOH-P and resin-P fractions in response to BCplus application in both, incubation-leaching and ryegrass cultivation experiments. This increase of the readily available P fraction in BCplus treated soils was confirmed by linear combination fitting (LCF) analysis on P K-edge XANES spectra of BCs particles and amended soils. The proportion of Ca-hydroxyapatite decreased, whereas the proportion of CaHPO4 increased in BCplus particles after amended soils had been incubated and leached and cropped by ryegrass. Based on P-XANES speciation as determined by LCF analysis, the proportion of inorganic Ca(H2PO4)2 increased in amended soils after BCplus application. These results indicated that soil amendment with BCplus particles leads to elevated P concentration and maintains more soluble P species than BC particles even after 230-days of ryegrass cultivation.

The area is characterized by dry periods, particularly during early summer. The long-term average annual precipitation rate and tempeature is 536 mm and 8.8°C, respectively. Weather data for the running period of V140 are available at the DWD (station number 03376 via https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/daily/kl/historical/). The V140 represents one of the few still active long-term field experiments on sandy soil. During the running period just smaller management measures changes have been done. Whereas originally questions to yield increase measures on sandy soil were in focus, present research put more focus on the effects of organic and mineral fertilization on essential aspects of the soil fertility. The V140 is around 0.5 ha and is located on a flat area. Before the establishment of V140 the site was cultivated uniformly. According to the German Guidelines Soil Assessment (Bodenschätzung) the dominating soil types are slightly loamy sand and sand (Sl4D and S4D). The most common soil sub type is Haplic Luvisol. The experiment includes 21 treatments: 5 levels of mineral fertilization combined with 4 levels of organic fertilization and one control.

The method essentially consists of the addition of varying concentrations of a base to aliquots of the soil sample. The resulting pH changes are recorded along with the base concentration added. Despite of being a natural soil forming process, soil acidification is a major agronomic challenge under humid climate conditions as soil acidity influences several yield relevant soil properties. It can be counterbalanced by the regular application of agricultural lime to maintain or re-establish soil fertility and to optimize plant growth and yield. A direct method to determine the lime requirement (LR) of an agricultural soil is the base neutralizing capacity (BNC). It is a soil-base titrations that is defined as the amount of soil acidity that is neutralized by a base in a given time interval to a certain pH value. One advantage of the BNC-based LR is that it studies the effect of base addition on the pH individually for each soil sample. This is in contrast to the conventional indirect LR method applied in Germany that estimates the soil’s LR based on empirical relationships derived in field experiments which does not further take into account (or measure) other factors affecting pH buffering such as clay mineralogy.

The spider mites were heterogeneously distributed in small concentrations in the soil. Soil colonizing spider mites did not affect spider mite abundance on plants and reversed. We observed that spider mite migration occurred primarily from the edge of the field adjacent to the weed strip. In 2020 and 2021, we investigated the efficacy of the predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) for suppressing spider mite hotspots in the cropland. We compared untreated spider mite hotspots with N. californicus treated hotspots and showed that a single release of predatory mites could result in a high level of control when spider mite infestation density was initially high. With this study, soil can be ruled out as a habitat for spider mites, and attention to spider mite pest control can be directed to plant infestations. The highly sensitive HRM real-time PCR assay was used for the quantification of the spider mites. Tetranychus urticae served as reference.

The initiator of this series of trials was Eduard von Boguslawski, who also foundedthe international working group ""IOSDV"". The LTE ""IOSDV"" in Rauischholzhausen was later continued and managed by Bernd Honermeier (1996 - 2021). The original idea of this LTE was to compare three farming systems (farm types), (1) system without organic fertilisation (simulating a cash crop farm), (2) system with organic fertilisation from livestock (farmyard manure, simulating a farm with livestock) and (3) system with organic fertilisation from plant residues (straw, catch crops and digestate from a biogas plant). In these arable farming systems, the classic cash crops sugar beet (since 2010 silage maize), winter wheat and winter barley are grown in a crop rotation (one after the other in time) and at the same time also next to each other every year. Due to the central importance of nitrogen as a plant nutrient, mineral N fertilisation was included as a test factor and combined with all other test factors in four different dosages so that possible interactions could be investigated. Since the LTE was set up at several locations, the influence of site and climatic conditions on soil properties and plant yields as a function of organic and mineral N fertilisation can also be investigated. The trial was extended in 1997 by a variant with ""compost fertilisation"" (without and with certified compost), with the same crop rotation and mineral N fertilisation. Land Use Type: Field crops Research Theme: Fertilization LTE Category: Fertilization Farming Category: Conventional Research Parameter: -Plant: total biomass yield, grain yield, harvest index -Soil: Ct, Corg, Nt, nitrate N Factors: - Factor A: Crops (sugar beet/maize, winter wheat, winter barley) - Factor B: N-fertilization (5 levels) - Factor C: Organic fertilization (3 levels) Research question: The trial aims to clarify the long-term effects of different organic fertilisation (manure from livestock compared to organic matter from plants) on soil properties (Ct/Corg, Nt, Nmin) and on biomass yields of maize, winter wheat and winter barley. It should also be clarified whether there is an interaction between organic fertilisation and mineral N fertilisation as well as between fertilisation and site conditions regarding soil parameters and plant yields and whether these factors thus influence each other.

Hence, an overview on soil-related stakeholders in Germany is required and was prepared in the form of dataset. The five listed-below stakeholder groups, which were assumed to have a direct or indirect influence on soil functions, were initially derived from the drivers of soil management (i.e. socio‐economic, biophysical, and technology). The groups were defined such as (1) state authorities, (2) civil societies, (3) land owners and land owner associations, (4) agricultural associations and (5) soil management-related enterprises. The stakeholders’ influence/power and interest were evaluated with the focus of organizations on the five main soil functions, i.e. production, water purification, carbon sequestration, biodiversity, recycling of nutrients and chemicals. The level of the influence/power and interest was estimated in a relative matter among the stakeholders by taking into account such parameters as the number of members/partners/employees, the visibility of projects/products/policies/press/publications etc. as well as the hierarchy among the state organizations. While the size of the privatized land area and its use were of the utmost importance for the land owners. In addition, the level of awareness of stakeholders’ activities played a role in assessing the stakeholders’ influence. Research domain: Soil Sciences Research question: The aim was to create a stakeholder database, representing soil-related stakeholders across Germany at the national scale.","land stakeholders, land, stakeholders, multi-stakeholder processes, stakeholder analysis, opendata, Stakeholder, Akteuren, Boden, Bodenmanagement, Bodenfunktion, Vernetzung, Landbesitzer, Zivilgesellschaft; Governance; Landwirtschaftsverband, Unternehmen",2021-06-26,BonaRes Centre,English,True

4b2b65c6-ff50-4669-99cc-ace343de3548,Scaling with ranked subsampling (SRS) algorithm for the normalization of species count data.,Scaling with ranked subsampling (SRS) algorithm for the normalization of species count data..,"--This data has been withdrawn by the author.-- The corrected dataset can be found here: https://doi.org/10.20387/bonares-2657-1NP3 The data has been withdrawn for following reasons: ""The published R-script was revised in the course of an external review process.” The data is no longer available for free reuse and will only be released by the data centre if there is a reasonable interest. Summary Scaling with ranked subsampling (SRS) is an algorithm for the normalization of species count data in ecology. So far, SRS has successfully been applied to microbial community data. The normalization by SRS reduces the number of reads in each sample in such a way that (i) the total count equals Cmin, (ii) each removed OTU is less or equally abundant that any preserved OTU, and (iii) the relative frequencies of OTUs remaining in the sample after normalization are as close as possible to the frequencies in the original sample. The algorithm consists of two steps. In the first step, the counts for all OTUs are divided by a scaling factor chosen in such a way that the sum of the scaled counts (Cscaled with integer or non-integer values) equals Cmin. The relative frequencies of all OTUs remain unchanged. In the second step, the non-integer count values are converted into integers by an algorithm that we dub ranked subsampling. The scaled count Cscaled for each OTU is split into the integer-part Cint by truncating the digits after the decimal separator (Cint = floor(Cscaled)) and the fractional part Cfrac (Cfrac = Cscaled - Cint). Since ΣCint ≤ Cmin, additional ∆C = Cmin - ΣCint reads have to be added to the library to reach the total count of Cmin. This is achieved as follows. OTUs are ranked in the descending order of their Cfrac values, which lie in the open interval (0, 1). Beginning with the OTU of the highest rank, single count per OTU is added to the normalized library until the total number of added counts reaches ∆C and the sum of all counts in the normalized library equals Cmin. For example, if ∆C = 5 and the seven top Cfrac values are 0.96, 0.96, 0.88, 0.55, 0.55, 0.55, and 0.55, the following counts are added: a single count for each OTU with Cfrac of 0.96; a single count for the OTU with Cfrac of 0.88; and a single count each for two OTUs among those with Cfrac of 0.55. When the lowest Cfrag involved in picking ∆C counts is shared by several OTUs, the OTUs used for adding a single count to the library are selected in the order of their Cint values. This selection minimizes the effect of normalization on the relative frequencies of OTUs. OTUs with identical Cfrag as well as Cint are sampled randomly without replacement.","Soil, Bioinformatics, Computer programming, opendata, bioinformatics, scaling with ranked subsampling, SRS, microbiome data normalisation, Boden",2020-07-01,BonaRes Data Centre,English,True

ba0e2b40-fb8c-4f50-bb5c-3e8709f733eb,Effects of alternative P fertilizers on bacterial N and P turnover depend on farm specific conditions - Part 2,Effects of alternative P fertilizers on bacterial N and P turnover depend on farm specific conditions - Part 2.,"We investigated the effects of three recycling-derived fertilizers with different P solubility on the capacity-based microbial nutrient turnover. These fertilizers were compared to conventional triple superphosphate (TSP) and no P fertilization (P0). We expected that reduced soil disturbance through deep loosening without soil turning would result in a higher abundance of bacteria involved in N and P turnover and an increased mycorrhizal colonization rate. Soil and rhizosphere samples were taken from two farms (Kiebitzbreite (KB) and Schmatzfelder Breite (SB)) in Central Germany during the 2018/2019 growing season when Triticum aestivum (cultivar Kredo at KB and Julius at SB) was cultivated at both sites. The abundance of microorganisms involved in P and nitrogen (N) turnover was determined using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (gcd, phoD, pitA, pstS, AMF, apr, chiA, nxrA, nifH, AOA, AOB, nirS, nirK, nosZ). Three individual plants were excavated per plot for nucleic acid extraction. Soil firmly adhered to the roots was sampled as rhizosphere soil. Bulk soil samples (0 - 10 cm) were taken from the plants at a 10 cm horizontal distance. In total, 240 samples were collected (2 fields, 5 fertilization treatments, 2 soil compartments, 4 plot replicates with 3 plants each) and sieved to 2 mm. Our data show that the fertilization treatment had less impact on bacteria involved in P turnover but significantly affected the abundance of bacteria catalyzing key steps of the N cycle. This was particularly pronounced for SB, where higher P solubility increased the abundance of bacteria associated with N mineralization.

The aim was to reveal the effects of 34 years of legumes (crimson clover, fava beans) and non-legumes (maize) in rotation combined with different fertilization regimes (no fertilization, PK fertilization, NPK fertilization) on soil phosphorus (P) storage throughout the uppermost meter of the soil profile. Calcium acetate lactate-extractable phosphorus (PCAL), considered as a proxy for plant-available P in German soils, were measured according to Schüller (1969). Although P storage tended to show a minimum at 30–50 cm, the coefficient of variation was relatively high and no significant differences in plant-available P were detected. However, the models indicated a likely increase in plant-available P under fava beans compared with the clover system.

This data collection consists of 25 individual tables which are related to each other. General description: In 1980 a fertilization trial started at the Institute for Biodynamic Research in Darmstadt (today Forschungsring e.V.), Germany. The experiment was set up as a strip design with four replicates, the treatments being farmyard manure treatments with and without biodynamic preparations and mineral fertilization, each at various levels. The objective of the project was to study the product quality of vegetables. After this four year project, interesting differences began to emerge with respect to the soil parameters of organic and mineral treatments. Thus the trial was continued. After some years of a transitional period without particular investigations, a detailed soil biological project was carried out in 1989-1991, focusing on the effects of fertilization upon C- and N-dynamics, enzyme activities and microbial biomass in the soil. A third experimental period (from 1992 to 2009) has focused on the yield formation of cultivated crops and the long-term effects of fertilization treatments upon soil and crop development.

However, due to agricultural practices P accumulated in soil, mostly in inaccessible forms. Bacteria play an important role to mobilize P. The release of P is rather a result of the bacterial need for C and N than the immediate need of P. Thus, we postulated that the addition of carbon and N would stimulate phosphorus mobilization by bacteria. Thus, we performed a metagenomic study to investigate soils from two agricultural sites (Rostock, Freising), which only received mineral N fertilizer or mineral N and organic fertilizer for more than 20 years. The metagenomic sequencing followed by taxonomic and functional annotations of the sequences by blasting against the NCBI-nr database (http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/ db/FASTA/nr.gz) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (June 2011) also revealed that independent of site and season, the relative abundance of genes involved in P turnover was not significantly affected by the addition of fertilizers. However, the type of fertilization had a significant impact on the composition of bacterial families harboring genes coding for the different P transformation processes. This gives rise to the possibility that fertilizers can substantially change phosphorus turnover efficiency by favoring different families. Additionally, none of the families involved in phosphorus turnover covered all investigated processes. Therefore, promoting bacteria which play an essential role specifically in mobilization of hardly accessible phosphorus could help to secure the phosphorus supply of plants in soils with low P input as so far the most abundant genes involved in the acquisition of external P sources in our study were those involved in solubilization and subsequent uptake of inorganic phosphorus. The raw sequencing data is available at the sequencing read archive (SRA) under the BioProject ID PRJNA385596 (SAMN06894543- SAMN06894566). Additionally, we determined dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and carbon (DOC) contents by extracting the soil with 0.01 M CaCl2 solution (soil to liquid ratio: 1:4) and the microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) and nitrogen (Nmic) content by applying a chloroform-fumigation-extraction procedure. Our data indicate that more the site then the treatment changed those values as stability of Cmic, Nmic as well as DOC and DON was high across the different fertilizer regimes. Only additional P fertilization slightly increased DOC values.

However, combining multiple plants species into a single crop creates practical challenges for the farmer. Another more practical solution is to combine cultivars of a same species with contrasted root systems. For instance, combining deep and shallow root systems may provide multiple advantages creating a more resilient and durable agro-ecosystem against water deficit. In the CROP project (Combining ROot contrasted Phenotypes for more resilient agro-ecosystem, funded by the German BMBF), we will focus on the plant species winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) for its economic importance and its susceptibility to future climate modifications. We evaluate if the two cultivars, UPQ12 and UPQ15 (developed at Hickey lab, University of Queensland, Australia; see for details (Rambla et al., 2022)), having different root insertion angle values (110 and 66°, respectively), lead to shallower and deeper root systems, respectively. These cultivars were obtained from the Hickey lab (University of Queensland, Australia). These two contrasted wheat root cultivars are studied in this experiment. Thirteen PVC columns (diameter = 8 cm, height = 45cm) were filled with silty loam soil from one testing site of the Research Center Julich, located in Selhausen (50.8659 N, 6.4471 E). The columns received two seeds each and were afterwards installed in a climate chamber (20°C day, 18°C night, 50% RH, 1000 μmol m−2s−1 of PAR from 6am to 8pm). The mean initial soil gravimetric water content (θsoil) was of 0.40 cm3 cm−3. Water was added twice a week to keep the θsoil value between 0.30 cm3 cm−3 to 0.44 cm3 cm−3. Fertiliser (7% Nitrate, 19% Ammonium) was added at 6 and 34 days after sowing (stage two leaves and tillering, respectively) in liquid solution supplied at a rate of 3 kg m−2. At 28, 35, 42 and 49 Days after Sowing three of the soil columns were randomly selected to extract the root systems from the soil columns segmented in 5 layers of 9cm. Soil samples from each layers were sampled and stored in a freezer at −20◦C. Shoot parts of the plant growing on these columns were also sampled at the same time. After sampling, stems and leaves were stored in a freezer at −20◦C The roots were then stored in 30% Ethanol solutions to be scanned (Expression 10000XL Model J181A; EPSON, Japan). The images were analyzed using the WinRhizo™ (Regent Instruments Inc., Quebec, Canada) software package for the determination of the total root length, surface and volume in each soil layers and per 100 μm diameter class of these soil layers. The Total Nitrogen content (TN) and Non Purgeable Organic Carbon content (NPOC) are respectively assed with the standard protocoles (soil extraction then analysed with Shimadzu© TOC 5050A).","Soil, opendata, Boden",2023-06-12,BonaRes Data Center,English,True

The data set included measurements of organic carbon, total nitrogen as well as their stable isotopes in plant and soil material. The growth and activity of the soil microbiome was investigated by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses. The transferred of C from plants towards the microbiome was measured by 13C label concentration in specific PLFA markers. More information is available: Gentsch, N., Boy, J., Batalla, J.D.K. et al.

More specifically, the efficiency for C uptake and the belowground input of recently photosynthesized C products and their partitioning in the rhizosphere was investigated. We hypothesized that diversified catch cropping systems would (I) increase photosynthetic C fixation with higher transport rates of newly assimilated C to the roots, (II) stimulate microbial growth through higher C utilization when C reaches the rhizosphere and (III) prolongate the C cycling throughout the plant-soil-microbiome system.","Soil, carbon cycle, biogeochemical cycle, soil microorganisms, soil organisms, agrobiodiversity, catch crops, cover plants, opendata, 13C isotope labeling, Boden, Kohlenstoffkreislauf, Biogeochemischer Kreislauf, Bioakkumulation, Fruchtfolge, Boden",2020-07-03,BonaRes Data Centre,English,True

A large variety of bacterial species are involved in early phases of the litter decomposition. However, the impact of reduced soil and leaf bacterial diversity on the initial litter decomposition process is poorly understood. Thus, we performed a litter decomposition experiment under controlled conditions. We compared maize leaf litter decomposition rates in soils with different levels of bacterial diversity, prepared from one natural soil (NS) by manipulating its bacterial diversity. Autoclaving and reinoculation with an extract of microbes from NS eliminated parts of the “rare biosphere”. This approach substantially reduced bacterial diversity in autoclaved soil (AS) and inoculated soil (IS) compared to NS, while no significant differences in bacterial abundance were determined among the soil treatments after a preincubation period (Week −2 to 0). Natural and autoclaved maize leaves were applied to the soil treatments and incubated for 6 weeks. Bacterial diversity and community composition were assessed on Week −2, 0, and 6 using 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. Bacterial and fungal abundance were assessed based on the copy number of the 16S rRNA gene and the ITS regions. Litter decomposition rates were assessed by calculating the quotient of remaining and initial litter amounts (dry weight basis). Due to the very small amount of litter materials left in litterbags on week 6, further molecular analysis was performed only on the maize samples collected on week 0. Our data suggested a positive correlation between litter decomposition rates and soil bacterial diversity. The soil with the highest bacterial diversity was dominated by oligotrophic bacteria including Acidobacteria, Nitrospiraceae, and Gaiellaceae, and its community composition did not change during the incubation. In the less diverse soils, oligotrophic bacteria were absent, but were replaced by copiotrophic bacteria such as Caulobacteraceae and Beijerinckiaceae, until the end of the incubation period. SourceTracker analysis revealed that litter-associated bacteria such as Beijerinckiaceae only became part of the bacterial communities in the less diverse soils. This suggests a pivotal role of oligotrophic bacteria during the early phases of litter decomposition and the predominance of copiotrophic bacteria at low diversity.

In contrast to mineral fertilizer, humus acts as long-term source of nutrients and is a basis element of soil fertility. The international fertilization trial (IOSDV) at the research facility Rinkenbergerhof at the LUFA Speyer (Germany) was set up in the year 1984 and planted with a repeating crop rotation: winter wheat, winter barley, and sugar beet. This data set comprises only the soil management variant “ploughing”. Other treatment factors were: (1) no organic amendment, farmyard (horse) manure treatment every three years to sugar beet fields, and crop residues + catch crop treatment; (2) without and with mineral N fertilization.

Parameters of the data set were determined on basis of standardized VDLUFA and DIN guidelines by the LUFA Speyer (Germany). The data set contains data of 72 samples, which were sampled during four sampling seasons with winter barley and sugar beet as crop plant and contained 3 field replicates of 6 treatment combinations. The bacterial bulk soil community structure of all samples was characterised by amplicon sequencing of the V1-V2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using primers 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGC-3′) and 357R (5'-CTGCTGCCTYCCGTA-3'). Results show that the bacterial community in the long term is mainly altered by mineral fertilization and, on a lower level by horse manure. The bacterial class Bacilli was an evident positive responder to manure application. However, both manure and crop residues are valueable amendments for farmland, since both mitigate the negative effects of mineral fertilizer on the connectivity of bacterial interaction networks.

Measurements of saturated and near-saturated soil hydraulic conductivities are time consuming and not practical for larger scales where they are mostly needed. The research community has therefore put effort in deriving pedotransfer functions to predict K using proxy variables. The precision of such pedotransfer functions has been very modest, however. As a result, recent studies have focused on assembling and analyzing bigger databases, aiming to find better predictors for the saturated and near-saturated soil hydraulic conductivities. A prominent example is the meta-database on tension-disk infiltrometer data compiled by Jarvis et al. (2013. Influence of soil, land use and climatic factors on the hydraulic conductivity of soil. Hydrology and Earth System Sciences 17(12), 5185-5195), who found that climate variables were better correlated with K than soil properties.

Chemical and physical measures of soil disinfection are the most employed countermeasures but inter-row plantings demonstrate that ARD is widely immobile in the soil, which causes the plant to face ARD affected and healthy soil simultaneously in the field. We simulated this situation in a split-root approach in two experiments using rhizoboxes, soil from the ORDIAmur ARD references sites Heidgraben and Ellerhoop and the apple rootstock M26. Root growth was monitored via the transparent front panel of the rhizoboxes and shoot growth was measured weekly. After two weeks, root systems from a subset of plants were sampled for expression analysis of ARD candidate genes. After eight weeks, masses of roots and shoots were recorded and contents of selected phenolic compounds were analyzed. Root and shoot growth were severely reduced whenever both compartments of the rhizobox were filled with ARD soil in comparison to both compartments filled with disinfected ARD soil. Plants with only half of the root system growing in ARD soil showed a local reduction in root growth with an intermediate shoot growth. In ARD affected roots, the expression of the three ARD biomarker genes, biphenyl synthase 3, biphenyl 4-hydroxylase and ethylene-responsive transcription factor 1B-like, was locally induced after two weeks in comparison to disinfected ARD or control soil. Phenolic compound profiles in the roots showed a high variation between samples and soils. The total phenolic content as well as the contents of epicatechin and an unknown phenolic compound were locally increased in roots grown in ARD soil in comparison to disinfected ARD soil after eight weeks. Our results show how apple plants focus their molecular defense towards ARD locally in the roots. The local nature of ARD presents both challenges in the assessment of ARD severity in the field as for possible management strategies involving soil tillage. Research domain: Plant Breeding Research question: The objectives of this study were (i) to link the previously observed localized growth response to a local response of the selected genes and phenolic metabolites and (ii) identify the phenolic compounds that can be useful in unraveling ARD.","Soil, apples, pome fruits, trees, fruit trees, soil sickness, opendata, Boden, Apfelnachbaukrankheit, Bodenm체digkeit, Lokalisierung, Boden",2021-02-19,BonaRes Data Centre,English,True

We focused on plant diversity (measured as species richness and functional trait diversity) and, in addition, on soil organism diversity as a potential mediator for the relationship of plant species diversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results showed positive effects of plant diversity on soil multifunctionality and soil organic carbon stocks along the entire gradient. Structural equation models revealed that plant diversity enhanced soil multifunctionality and soil organic carbon by increasing the diversity of belowground organisms. These positive effects of plant diversity on soil multifunctionality and soil fauna were not restricted to native plant species only, but were also exerted by non-native species, although to a lesser degree. We conclude that enhancing diversity in plants and soil fauna of urban grasslands can increase the multifunctionality of urban soils and also add to their often underestimated but very valuable role in mitigating effects of climate change.","Soil, biodiversity, urban areas, field experimentation, grasslands, soil functions, soil organic carbon, invasive species, opendata, ecological novelty, novel ecosystems, Boden, biodiversity, urban ecology, field experiment, grassland, soil function, soil organism, exotic species",2022-01-27,BonaRes Data Centre,English,True

For example, the higher the level of GCFs, the lower the plant biomass and soil water stable aggregation. We also find that MP applied as a single factor had minimal effects on soil properties and crop growth. However, when combined with other individual factors, it significantly altered the effect size, sometimes even causing directional change. Our results revealed that the interaction between MP and other GCFs is not an additive response. Due to the characteristics of MP, the interaction mechanism between heavy metal and MP is obviously different from the response between drought and MP, and their combined effects on the soil-plant system may fundamentally vary Factor interactions are key to understanding and predicting how GCFs influence soil and plants. With an increasing number of GCFs involved, it becomes more and more complicated to predict effects on ecosystems. Our study is among the first to systematically examine how microplastic acts in combination with a range of other important environmental drivers, and thus offers a first step toward understanding these elusive interactive effects.","Soil, microplastics, opendata, Multiple level; Winter wheat; Plant-soil system; Soil properties; Global change factors, Boden",2024-02-27,ZALF,English,True

One way out of this dilemma could be to create an additional stable soil C sink by inducing SOC under saturation in the topsoil. In the past, attempts were made by abrupt topsoil dilution through subsoil admixture by means of deep tillage but with varying degrees of success. This was partly due to a lack of knowledge about the impact of soil condition like erosion state and N fertilization form ensuring optimum C input into the soil on the desired additional SOC accumulation and partly due to the lack of suitable experimental approaches to record the effect of all relevant factors simultaneously. To help solve these problems, a three-factorial experimental field trial were established: I.) ""moderate topsoil dilution"" (diluted vs non-diluted), II.) ""N fertilization form"" (mineral, i.e., calcium ammonium nitrate and urea vs organic, i.e., digestate) and III.) ""soil types"" (Calcic Luvisol, Nudiargic Luvisol, and Calcaric Regosol) covering the typical range of erosion states in the hummocky ground moraine landscape of NE Germany.

This makes it all the more important in the future to use the natural microbiome of the soil effectively, especially against the backdrop of the increasing problems of global warming and resource consumption. Symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi is a tool that is used by countless plants to support the supply of nutrients or counteract drought stress. It can be assumed that different varieties have different tendencies to interact with the microbiome. The aim is therefore to gain insights into whether the choice of variety at a location allows a statement to be made about the mycorrhizal tendency and whether this consequently influences the phosphorus nutrient status in the soil and plant. To this end, two different maize varieties were investigated in a two-year trial (2021 and 2022) on a permanent trial site in Rostock under four fertilization regimes with regard to their mycorrhizal propensity and microbial phosphorus mobilization and availability. Research domain: Soil Sciences Research question: It was investigated to what extend the tendency/abundance of mycorrhizal fungi formation on maize is influenced by the choice of crop variety and whether it affects the phosphorus nutrient supply in the soil and plant.","Soil, phosphorus, mycorrhizae, maize, soil, plant available phosphorus, microorganisms, opendata, Boden, inspireidentifiziert; Soil, Agricultural and aquaculture facilities; Mycorrhiza, soil, soil biology, phosphorus, microbial ressource",2024-03-25,ZALF,English,True

After all wild bees were identified to species level, from a subset of samples we measured the Intertegular distance ITD (distance between the wings) as body size and searched for functional traits regarding sociality (solitary, eusocial, parasitic) nesting type (below- or aboveground), and lecty (poly- or oligolectic). In addition, biotic and abiotic characteristics of these kettle holes were recorded to evaluate how they affect wild bee diversity. These factors included size of the kettle hole, the degree of isolation (number of neighboring kettle holes at different distances), percentage of flowering species and total of plant species (herbs and woody plants). We tested the effect of all these factors on wild bee abundance and bee species richness, as well on body size and functional traits. - Applied Methods for sampling and identification: Collection of individuals using colour traps. One trap had 6 coloured plastic containers (white, blue and yellow) placed in three levels randomly. Water with some drops of soap was added to each container and traps were place in each kettle hole during 48 hours. A total of 4 traps were set up in each kettle hole and a total of 36 kettle holes were studied. After 2 days insects trapped in the water were collected without differentiating the colour of the plastic container. Bee individuals were separated and taken to the lab for further preparation and identification. - Bee specimens were pinned and dried at room temperature. Individuals were identified until species level by specialists K. Rupik from Bielefeld University and C. Saure at the Natural History Museum in Berlin. Information about functional traits regarding sociality, lecty and nesting were compiled from the literature with the final list of species. Body size was characterized as intertegular distance (distance between wings) measured in a subset of randomly selected individuals per species.

AMF come from soil or root samples from a two growing-season mesocosm experiment mimicking a crop rotation, with a first phase growing AM or non-AM and/or rhizobial or non rhizobial precrops followed with an AM crop. During the second phase, organic fertilization was applied (saw dust or wheat straw). The aim is to test the effect of precrop plant symbiotic functional group on following crop AM fungal diversity and abundance. Four crop plant species were used to have a combination of all symbiotic groups: spring canola (Brassica napus cv. Medicus, NPZ, non-rhizobial / non-AM), withe lupine (Lupinus albus cv. Energy, Feldsaaten Freudenberger, rhizobial / non-AM), spring barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. Barke, Saatzucht Breun, non rhizobial/AM) faba bean (Vicia faba cv. Tiffany, NPZ, rhizobial / AM). The succeeding crop was winter barley (Hordeum vulgare, cv. Antonella, Nordsaat Saatzucht, non-rhizobial / AM). The AMF community structure was analyzed by amplicon sequencing of the D1-D2 region of the fungal LSU (28S) rRNA gene using the primers LR2rev (5'-GAAAAGAACTTTGAAAA-3') and LR3 (5'-CCGTGTTTCAAGACG-3'). The taxonomy and sequence for each sequence variant is included. The sequences were generated using the primers LR2rev (5'-GAAAAGAACTTTGAAAA-3') and LR3 (5'-CCGTGTTTCAAGACG-3'). The results revealed that the mycorrhizal precrop symbiotic group (AM or not AM), but not the rhizobial one (N2-fixer or not N2-fixer), affected the richness and composition of AM fungi in the soil. The effect on composition, but not on richness, persisted in the following crop, demonstrating a legacy effect of precrop functional group. However, this effect was weaker than that of contemporary factors such as nutrient addition. AMF community composition correlated to decreasing crop yield after AM precrops. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that differences in AMF communities pertained at deep phylogenetic levels. These findings suggest negative plant-soil feedbacks within the AM symbiosis in agro-ecosystems typical of western Europe, driven by the consistent selection of deep clades of AM fungi. The raw fastq read files are available under BioProject accession number ENA PRJEB36419. The sequence variant sequences are available at ENA under accession number LR761341-LR761569.

2dcc638c-6eca-4f91-a860-8ccd5cf3a2ef,Shoot development and nutritional status of maize 1st crop rotation cycle,Shoot development and nutritional status of maize 1st crop rotation cycle.,"A central aspect when including catch crops into a crop rotation is the conservation of nutrients in their biomass for the subsequently grown crop. However, the nutrient carry-over to the following crop depends not only on the amount of nutrients accumulated in individual catch crop plant materials but also on the specific degradation properties of their tissues, i.e. the temporal quantitative and qualitative release of scavenged nutrients. In our experiment we investigated the morphological and nutritional response of maize to 6 different pre-grown catch crop variants including pure stands and mixtures. At two field sites in Germany (Asendorf - Lower Saxony and Triesdorf - Bavaria), maize (seeding rate: 9.4 seeds m-2) was established either after pure cultures of mustard, phacelia, bristle oat and Egyptian clover, after a mixture of these 4 species or after a commercial mixture of the DSV with a higher species diversity called TerraLife MaisPro. Their single-species nutrient accumulation was already published in the BonaRes-database under “Catch crop nutrient uptake 1st crop rotation cycle”. Fallow plots were included as control. Maize was fertilized with 160 kg N ha-1 in Asendorf and 190 kg N ha-1 in Triesdorf. Since nutrient release from catch cops might temporarily vary, we studied the morphological and nutritional response of maize at 4 developmental stages ranging from leaf development over shoot elongation and flowering to cob development. As morphological parameters we investigated the number of leaves, tillers and cobs. In order to study the nutritional response we examined the shoot biomass, chlorophyll content or SPAD values and different nutrient concentrations in young and old leaves as well as the nitrate concentration in the press sap obtained from a 1 cm-piece of the stem base as marker for the nitrogen nutritional status. At both locations, the experiment was repeated in two subsequent years (2016 and 2017) and represented each the initial starting point of a wheat-catch crop-maize long-term rotation. Thus, maize response was tested in total in 4 environments. In general we could not observe any significant impact of the pre-grown catch crop variant on morphological or nutritional shoot parameters at any of the investigated developmental stages and in none of the test environments. However, catch crop effects often develop in the long run when included regularly in a crop rotation.","Zea mays, Poaceae, Shoots, leaves, Nitrates, Nitrogen, Elements, Chlorophylls, nutrient cycling in ecosystems, Plant morphology, Catch cropping, Crop rotation, Catch crops, Sinapis alba, Phacelia tanacetifolia, Mustard, Trifolium alexandrinum, Mustard, Phacelia, oats, maize, Phosphorus, Potassium, Iron, Carbon, Magnesium, Zinc, Manganese, Tillering, biomass, Landwirtschaftliche Anlagen und Aquakulturanlagen, Maize, Nutritional state, pre-grown catch crops mineral elements, opendata",2019-01-16,BonaRes Data Centre,English,True

A solid-solution ratio of 1:20 was chosen for gibbsite, and a solid-solution ratio of 1:200 was chosen for ferrihydrite and the Fe:Al-hydroxide mixtures due to their high specific surface areas and P-adsorption capacity. The initial P-concentrations for the adsorption experiments were 150 µmol l-1, 1000 µmol l-1 and 2000 µmol l-1 KH2PO4 for gibbsite and 1000 µmol l-1, 2000 µmol l-1 and 5000 µmol l-1 KH2PO4 for ferrihydrite and the Fe:Al-hydroxides with a 0.01 mol l-1 CaCl2-background electrolyte solution, adjusted to a pH of 6. For P measurements, the gibbsite and ferrihydrite samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 336 × G, while the Fe:Al-hydroxide samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 21572 × G.

8170ee67-01c9-42b6-82ae-1b6442e5bdc3,Field experiment FV 4 Braunschweig – harvest of winter barley 2014,Field experiment FV 4 Braunschweig – harvest of winter barley 2014.,"The phosphorus (P) taken up by organisms cannot be substituted from any other element; the only source of an increasing P demand for feeding the growing global population is mineable rock phosphate, upgraded to mineral P fertilizer. There are concerns about the global reserves of rock phosphates, expressed in terms of “peak phosphorus” (demand production). Bone char (BC) produced of de-fatted and de-gelatinized bones (15% P, 28% Calcium, 1% Magnesium) from slaughterhouses by a pyrolysis process could be an alternative source of P. Phosphorus in BC is mainly bound in a structure similar to hydroxylapatite (HA) in accordance with their origin from bones. Generally, P in HA is of low solubility and, consequently, it cannot be expected that bones or BC have a high fertilization value. Consequently, further attempts were directed to increase the P solubility of BC by a sulfur (S) enrichment leading to so called BCplus (patent DE102011010525). A former long-term field P fertilization trial (1985-2008) led to distinctive differences in available soil P (PCAL) concentrations. For some detailed description of the former experiment and further soil information see: Vogeler, I.; Rogasik, J.; Funder, U.; Panten, K.; Schnug, E. (2009) Effect of tillage systems and P-fertilization on soil physical and chemical properties, crop yield and nutrient uptake. Soil and Tillage Research 103 (1): 137-143.The resulting differences in soil P were conserved below an extensively managed grassland until 2013 when the experiment was ploughed to a depth of 25 cm and oat was seeded. After the harvest of 2013, the newly designed experiment (FV 4) was established testing the fertilizing potential of BC and BCplus. According to their mean PCAL concentrations (0-30 cm) one third of the plots were assigned to soil class A (11 mg kg-1 PCAL), B (21 mg kg-1 PCAL), and C (47 mg kg-1 PCAL) each. The experiment was set up as a completely randomized block design with three replicates, a plot size of 5.75 m * 17.5 m, and crop rotation of winter barley, winter oilseed rape, winter wheat, lupine and winter rye. Chisel ploughing and ploughing to a depth of 25 cm incorporates crop residues before seeding. Additionally to a control without P fertilization (P0), three different types of P fertilizer (BC, BCplus, TSP) are applied to an equivalent of 45 kg ha-1 P once a year shortly before seeding since autumn 2013. This data set presents the first harvest of winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L., variety OTTO) in 2014.

142faafb-4e71-4b1e-b550-ca6864f5234b,pH-dependency of P adsorption kinetics on goethite,pH-dependency of P adsorption kinetics on goethite .,"P adsorption was investigated on synthetic and commercially available goethite (99 %, Alfa Aesar). The composition and crystallinity was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analyses with an Empyrean powder diffractometer (PANalytical) with Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15418 nm). The determination of the d-values and the verification of the calculated lattice parameter were performed using the XPowder software. The specific surface area of 17.2 m2 g-1 was determined with an Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome) using a five-point BET measurement and N2. The point of zero charge (PZC) was determined using potentiometric titration by weighing 0.5 g of goethite into 50 ml PE-tubes and adding of 10 ml of a 0.02 M, 0.2 M, and 2 M KCl solution, respectively. The KCl solutions were diluted with ultrapure water to a total volume of 20 ml, leading to final concentrations of 0.01 M, 0.1 M, and 1 M, respectively. After closing the tubes, the samples were equilibrated for 4 days at 25°C to reach an equilibration pH value. Following, the suspension was titrated with 0.1 M KOH, and the pH was recorded after each addition of KOH as a function of the volume. A similar procedure was used for the blank solutions. The adsorbed amounts of H+ or OH- were calculated from the amount of KOH added to the samples minus the amount of KOH used by blank titration. The titration curves of the three different concentration steps intersect at the PZC, which was 8.8 for pure goethite without adsorbed P. P adsorption on goethite was studied in a batch setup at the pH values of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Therefore, goethite sample material (5 g) for the respective pH steps was adjusted to pH 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12, respectively, in ultrapure water with 0.01 M HCl (pH 4), or 0.1 M to 5 M KOH (pH 6 to 12) using a Potentiometric Compact Titrator G20S and combined DGi115-SC pH electrode (Mettler-Toledeo) under continuous stirring. For P adsorption, 0.5 g of goethite and 40 ml of a 0.15 mmol l-1 KH2PO4, solution, adjusted to pH 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 as well, were mixed to achieve a solid-solution ratio of 1:80. The goethite- KH2PO4 mixture was shaken horizontally at 150 motions min-1 for 24 h. The P concentration in the solution was determined after reaction times of 2, 24, 48, and 168 h. The samples have been centrifuged for 15 min at 3500 rpm and the clear supernatant was filtrated by using P-poor Whatmann 512 ½ filters. The concentrations of P and Fe were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The adsorption experiments were done in duplicate. Under real conditions in the soil, an influence of the P sorption on the pH is to be expected. Therefore, the pH change was taken into account both at the beginning and at the end of the adsorption experiments. The pH change was measured in a reference experiment that was treated exactly under the same conditions as P adsorption experiment. The amount of adsorbed P was referred to both the initial and the final pH. Considering the initial pH, P adsorption on goethite was highest for pH 8, yielding a P surface coverage of 0.75 µmol m-2 after a reaction time of 168 h, followed by pH 6 with 0.72 µmol m-2, and pH 4 with 0.68 µmol m-2. The extent of adsorption decreased from pH 8 to 10 with 0.58 µmol m-2 and was lowest for pH 12 with 0.18 µmol m-2. The solution pH decreased for the initial pH 4 to 3.9., and for the initial pH of 6, the final pH was 5.0.

Alp with mean temperature 7.5°C and annual precipitation 1042 mm. In each region, measurements were conducted over a time period of nine cropping seasons from 2009 to 2018. The backbone of the investigation was formed by six eddy-covariance stations (EC) which measured fluxes of water, energy and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere at half hourly resolution. This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes. Moreover, more than 1,200 soil samples were taken to study changes of carbon and nitrogen contents. One station in each region has now been set up as continuous observatories of state variables and fluxes in intensively managed agricultural fields.

However, those processes are still not fully understood. Thus, we aimed 1) to study the redox induced-release of phosphorus (P) in different arable soil horizons as affected by their properties and the redox potential (EH)-dependent changes on governing factors such as soil pH, Al, Fe, Mn, Ca, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and 2) to examine the impact of addition of carbon sources (rice straw + glucose) on the soil EH/pH changes and on the relevant changes on mobilization of phosphorus in the different soils. We collected top, subsurface, and subsoil horizons from three different soil profiles representing different arable soils originating from Germany, treated the soils with straw + glucose, flooded the treated and untreated soils in triplicates and incubated them for 432 hours. Soil EH, pH, and salinity were measured and soil slurry was collected from all treatments after different incubation times (e., 15 minutes to 432 hours) and analyzed for total dissolved P, PO43-, SO42-, Fe, Al, Fe, Mn, Ca, DIC, and further anions concentrations. Results showed that application of straw and glucose changed significantly soil EH, pH, and total dissolved P content as compared to the untreated soils. Soil EH varied from +194 to +310 mV in the untreated soil and from -520 to +230 mV in the treated soils. Soil pH varied from 6.6 to 7.9 in the untreated soil and from 4.2 to 7.7 in the treated soils. Total dissolved P varied from 0.04 to 0.70 mg/l in the untreated soil and from 0.05 to 10.5 mg/l in the treated soils. Straw + glucose-treated soils exhibited a wider range of EH, a lower pH, and a higher dissolved P content than the un-treated soils. The pH of the treated soils decreased significantly with decreasing soil EH. Total dissolved P in the top soils increased significantly under reducing acidic conditions as compared to the oxidizing alkaline conditions. Our results suggest that the release of P in acidic arable soils rich in organic carbon should be of concern from both agricultural and environmental points of view.","Soil, opendata, Hydromorphic arable soils, phosphorus loss, sustainable management, XANES; quantum chemical calculations, Boden",2020-03-06,ZALF,English,True

The assessment of soil values has been done according to the soil valuation law (Bodenschätzungsgesetz, BodSchätzG) with an established method for mapping and evaluating the natural productivity of all agriculturally areas including arable and grassland in Germany. The soil quality estimates result in values that indicate the ratio of the productivity of the estimated to the most productive agricultural area with a maximum value of 100 for arable land and 88 for grassland. The values are determined from information on soil type, geological formation of the soil, status level, and general climate and water conditions. The results of the assessment of soil values are available in digital form via the official real estate cadastre information system (Amtliches Liegenschaftskatasterinformationssystem, ALKIS) and are available throughout Germany (with the exception of Berlin). We extracted the soil values from the ALKIS for the whole state of Brandenburg to make these available digitally for further use.","Soil, soil fertility, quality, soil properties, farming systems, land valuation, arable land, grassland soils, ecological soil types, agricultural and rural legislation, opendata, Boden, Flurstücke/Grundstücke (Katasterparzellen), Bodennutzung",2020-09-03,BonaRes Data Centre,English,True

Summary Scaling with ranked subsampling (SRS) is an algorithm for the normalization of species count data in ecology. So far, SRS has successfully been applied to microbial community data. The normalization by SRS reduces the number of reads in each sample in such a way that (i) the total count equals Cmin, (ii) each removed OTU is less or equally abundant that any preserved OTU, and (iii) the relative frequencies of OTUs remaining in the sample after normalization are as close as possible to the frequencies in the original sample. The algorithm consists of two steps. In the first step, the counts for all OTUs are divided by a scaling factor chosen in such a way that the sum of the scaled counts (Cscaled with integer or non-integer values) equals Cmin. The relative frequencies of all OTUs remain unchanged. In the second step, the non-integer count values are converted into integers by an algorithm that we dub ranked subsampling. The scaled count Cscaled for each OTU is split into the integer-part Cint by truncating the digits after the decimal separator (Cint = floor(Cscaled)) and the fractional part Cfrac (Cfrac = Cscaled - Cint). Since ΣCint ≤ Cmin, additional ∆C = Cmin - ΣCint reads have to be added to the library to reach the total count of Cmin. This is achieved as follows. OTUs are ranked in the descending order of their Cfrac values, which lie in the open interval (0, 1). Beginning with the OTU of the highest rank, single count per OTU is added to the normalized library until the total number of added counts reaches ∆C and the sum of all counts in the normalized library equals Cmin. For example, if ∆C = 5 and the seven top Cfrac values are 0.96, 0.96, 0.88, 0.55, 0.55, 0.55, and 0.55, the following counts are added: a single count for each OTU with Cfrac of 0.96; a single count for the OTU with Cfrac of 0.88; and a single count each for two OTUs among those with Cfrac of 0.55. When the lowest Cfrag involved in picking ∆C counts is shared by several OTUs, the OTUs used for adding a single count to the library are selected in the order of their Cint values. This selection minimizes the effect of normalization on the relative frequencies of OTUs. OTUs with identical Cfrag as well as Cint are sampled randomly without replacement.","Bioinformatics, statistics, Statistical methods, microbial ecology, scaling with ranked subsampling, SRS, species count data, normalization, next generation sequencing data, microbial ecology, opendata, Bioinformatics, statistics, Boden",2020-02-27,BonaRes Data Centre,English,True

This, together with an increasing demand for fertilizer and pesticide reduction has led to consider different and new approaches. We investigate the effect of Hartmannibacter diazotrophicus strain E19, a plant growth promoting rhizobacterium, in order to enhance the production of wheat and barley under low energy input. For that, we analyze the effect of three factors: organic fertilizer (with and without, only wheat), row distance (15 cm and 50 cm), and bacterial inoculation (E19 and control) at two different organic experimental field stations (Gladbacherhof and Kleinhohenheim). The dataset provides information about different parameter determined from rhizosphere soil and root samples collected at two different developmental stages (flowering and milk/fully ripe), as well as, the grain yield, straw yield, 1000 kernel mass, and seed quality during the seasons 2020-2021 and 2021-2022. The following soil parameter were evaluated: ammonium, nitrate, carbon-nitrogen ratio, microbial biomass, the respiration activity using different carbon sources (glucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, arginine). These data sets are currently under evaluation and complemented with the quantification of strain E19 from root samples through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and the metabarcoding sequencing of the bacterial communities based on 16S rRNA genes obtained from rhizosphere soil samples during the two seasons. Data obtained for wheat quality are yield parameter (grain yield, straw yield, thousand kernel mass), protein concentration, different fractions of protein (albumin concentration, albumin percentage, gliadin concentration, gliadin percentage, glutenin concentration, glutenin percentage, gluten concentration, gluten percentage, gliadin to glutenin ratio), protein subtractions (ω-gliadin, γ_gliadin, α/β_gliadin, HMW, D_LMW, B_LMW, C_LMW, total LMW, HMW/LMW ratio), baking parameters (water absorption, baking loss 1 hour , loaf volume, hardness after 1 hour, hardness after 7 days, freshness retention, springiness after 1 hour, springiness after 7 days, elasticity), cations such as Fe ,Zn, Mg, K, Ca, and important metabolites such as proline, amylose and total starch were determined in order to evaluate the effect of the different factors mentioned above.

Four soil monoliths were sampled along a Btg-CBkg horizon boundary of an Eroded Haplic Luvisol (monoliths: e_ha_LV_1, e_ha_LV_2) and a CBkg-sand lense boundary of a Haplic Regosol (monoliths: ha_RG_3, ha_RG_4). The monoliths were placed under a rainfall simulator in the laboratory and 12 tensiometers and 6 FDR-sensors to measure soil matric potential and soil water content were installed in the upper and lower horizon. Vertical flow through the monoliths and lateral flow along the horizon boundary was measured via a bottom and a side suction disc. The experimental procedure is described in detail in the technical note by Ehrhardt et al. (2022). The dataset includes for each monolith a detailed protocol of applied rainfall rates and pressured heads at the side and bottom suctions discs. For each measurement period (data was subdivided in up to four periods due to large data size)of the monoliths data of the tensiometers and FDR-sensors (calibrated and uncalibrated) as well as calibration data for these sensors are included. Also, the location of the sensors and horizon boundary and the amount of water drained from the side and the bottom of the monolith is given. Two commented R-Scripts give examples on how to plot and interpret the data given for each monolith.","Soil, laboratory experimentation, subsurface runoff, soil hydraulic properties, tensometers, soil water content, opendata, Lateral subsurface flow, Boden, Germany, Brandenburg, Uckermark, Quillow, Dedelow, Site CarboZALF",2023-11-23,Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research,English,True

This data collection consists of 26 individual tables which are related to each other. General description: In organic farms under low yielding site conditions (e.g. sandy soils, dry climate) the size of animal husbandry is frequently restricted by the fact that the site conditions allow for a limited quantity of forage growing only. Some of those farms are even stockless farms. The positive effects of farmyard manure can poorly or not at all be used. Plant based organic fertilizer, e.g. legume biomass or pulse meal, can be an alternative, however, their effects on crop yield and quality and on soil organic matter development has to be carefully studied. This was the objective of the second long-term trial “Field E” in Darmstadt, Germany. The experiment was set up in 1996, using a randomized block design with six replicates and 5×5 m experimental plots. A 5 m strip was left between the blocks, which was cropped identically to the experimental plot but remained unfertilized. The experiment consisted of seven treatments: (i) inorganic fertilizers, (ii) plant based organic fertilizer, (iii) plant based organic fertilizer with addition of biodynamic preparations, (iv) cattle farmyard manure, (v) cattle farmyard manure with addition of biodynamic preparations, (vi) high level of cattle farmyard manure, and (vii) high level of cattle farmyard manure with biodynamic preparations.

The study sites correspond to agricultural fields located within an area of 25 km 2 (6°15’0’ E to 6°21’0’ E and 50°50’5’ N to 50°53’0’ N) of an open-cast lignite mine at Inden, between Cologne, Aachen, Mönchengladbach, and Düsseldorf. The soil extraction, deposition and recultivation process leads to a chronosequence of fields recultivated from less than one year to fields recultivated for 52 years, at samling time of 2016. During the first three years, fields are permanently covered by alfalfa and never receive artificial fertilisers or biocide treatments (fields recultivated since 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, referred to as phase 1). In the following two years, agricultural practises are resumed with barley cropping by RWE Power AG, and a N:P:K (1:0.4:0.6) fertilisation of 437 kg ha−1 a−1 (fields recultivated since 2012 and 2011 referred to as phase 2). Afterwards, fields are returned to farmers and conventionally managed with a crop sequence of winter wheat after sugar beet, one tillage a year to 30 cm depth, and a continuous management practice following area-typical agricultural practice and plant-protection guidelines (fields recultivated since 2006, 1990, 1979, 1971 and 1964, referred to as phase 3). Other agricultural fields that have not yet been subject to extraction were sampled too (referred to as pre-mining phase). They are a total of 115 samples (5 replicates per field x 2 seasons, each field corresponds to a year of recultivation). Four samples were removed due to failed PCR. The soil fungal community was analyzed with 300 bp paired-end Illumina MiSeq sequencing of ITS2 sequences (primers fITS7: 5′‐GTGARTCATCGAATCTTTG‐3′ / ITS4: 5′‐TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC‐3′). Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were inferred using DADA2 in R. Taxonomic annotations were performed using the IDTaxa algorithm implemented in the DECIPHER R package, against UNITE (version of 10.05.2021). Raw sequencing reads are available at ENA under study project PRJEB51095. The DNA sequences of the fungal amplicon sequence variants are available at ENA under accession numbers OV986018-OV989728. The processed dataset including the ASV count table, ASV taxonomy, and sample metadata compiled as a phyloseq R object stored in a single .RDS R file, as well as ASV guild annotation using Funguild database, are available at figshare at (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20160578). To read the data in the software R, use readRDS() function). Here we upload at the BONARES data centre the relative abundance of each fungal guild (% of DNA sequences) per samples along with basic metadata for easy reuse.

Therefore, a field experiment with three different P-fertilizer treatments was carried out from 2017 to 2019 Northeastern Germany: BCplus (KK, 600 kg ha-1 every sixth year) and triple superphosphate (Min, 35 - 45 kg ha-1 annually) are compared with a non-P-fertilized control (P0). We performed measurements of soil total and plant available element concentrations to investigate P-fertilizer effects on P release and P uptake by the crop plants. In 2019 and 2020, deviating from the plan, only one sampling was carried out: in 2019, the crops were cut after the interim harvest due to the prolonged drought. Thus, a final harvest was not possible. The following year, due to the effects of the Corona restrictions, an intermediate harvest was not possible.","Soil, opendata, Boden, Soil, Phosphorus, field experimentation, Phosphate fertilizers, Boden",2021-09-14,BonaRes Data Centre,English,True

Compound events are defined as multiple extreme events occurring together, in this case, heat (high temperatures) and drought (low precipitation). Climatic values are considered extreme if they are higher (or lower in the case of precipitation) than certain thresholds. The thresholds were defined via the percentiles of values in the climatically more stable reference period between 1951 and 1980. The temperature and precipitation values were obtained from the weather stations run by the German Meteorological Service (DWD). For the study period 1981 – 2021, they were brought on the spatial scale of the Bavarian counties via Thiessen-Polygons. For the reference period, the values were not differentiated spatially but applied for whole Bavaria which leads to a higher number of extreme events in dryer regions. Temporally, the extreme events were differentiated for the development phases of maize and winter wheat. The percentiles were applied to the climatic values from the whole development phases (May – October for maize, November – July for winter wheat, always for the whole months), the vegetative phase (May – July for maize, November – April for winter wheat), and the reproductive phase (August – October for maize, May – July for winter wheat). To account for the water storage in the soil, in addition to the precipitation of one day, extremes of the precipitation sums of this day with the 9, 19, and 29 preceding days were calculated as well. Multiple extreme events were defined as compound events when they fall together in the same county and on the same day. These compound events were calculated in five severity levels depending on the applied percentiles (above the 95th percentile for temperature values and below the 10th percentile for precipitation as the most severe level, followed by the 90th and 20th, 85th and 30th, 80th and 40th, as well as the 75th and 50th percentile). From the daily compound events, finally, the yearly sums were built for each county. The first column of the dataset describes from how many days the precipitation sum was built, in which development phases the compound events lie, and with which severity level. For each of these 120 combinations, the values for the years 1981 – 2021 in the 96 counties are given. These values are used to examine how differently defined compound events affect the variability of maize and winter wheat yields.

The significance of mycorrhizal fungi in arable soils for the P supply of crops will increase with a decreased P fertilization. The impact of catch crops in the crop rotation on mycorrhizal fungi is scarcely known. Due to the combined ability for N2 fixation and efficient P mobilization the impact of Seradella as legume catch crop was tested under subsequent grown barley.","Soil, opendata, Boden",2021-11-09,BonaRes Data Centre,English,True

Columns (1-5) contain the information on the sampling point location 2. Columns (6-8) are the relative wind speed which is the ratio between wind speed inside the agroforestry system relative to the open field without trees (monoculture). The relative wind speed was simulated with the Large Eddy Simulation model ASAM (All Scale Atmospheric Model, Jähn et al. (2015). The relative wind speed was calculated for three different wind directions (N, NW, W), for a tree height of 5 m and at a height of 0.5 m above ground. 3. Columns (9-11) contain the number of days with potential erosion risk for the reference and agroforestry site. These columns are a combination of measured wind speed data at the Forst monoculture site and the modeled LES data (column 6-8). Potential erosion risk in this dataset is defined as wind speeds above 5m/s at 0.5m height above the ground. In total, the dataset contained 742 days of at least one 30 min maximum wind speed measurement. Calculating the potential erosion risk at 0.5m height: step 1. Erosion risk at the monoculture site The maximum wind speeds at the monoculture site were measured at 3.5m height. By assuming a logarithmic wind profile the 30min maximum wind speeds were converted into maximum wind speeds at 0.5m height. A maximum wind speed larger 5m/s per day is considered as potential erosion risk. The number of days with potential erosion risk was summed. step 2. Erosion risk at the agroforestry site The maximum wind speeds from step 1 were multiplied by the relative wind speeds obtained from the LES model for the different wind directions. This results in spatially distributed maximum wind speeds inside the agroforestry system. Each wind speed above 5m/s, is considered as a potential erosion risk event. A maximum wind speed larger 5m/s per day is considered as potential erosion risk. The number of days with potential erosion risk was summed for each measurement point.

To test the dimension and consequences of P fertilizer impacts under maize (Zea mays L.), three fertilizer treatments (1) triple superphosphate (TSP, 21–30 kg P ha–1 annually), biowaste compost (ORG, 30 Mg ha–1 wet weight every third year) and a combination of both (OMI) were compared to a non-P-fertilized control (C) in 2015 and 2016. The test site was a long-term field experiment on a Stagnic Cambisol in Rostock (NE Germany). Soil microbial biomass P (Pmic) and soil enzyme activities involved in P mobilization (phosphatases and ß-glucosidase), plant available P content (double lactate-extract; PDL), mycorrhizal colonization, shoot biomass, and shoot P concentrations were determined. P deficiency led to decreased P immobilization in microbial biomass, but the maize growth was not affected. TSP application alone promoted the P uptake by the microbial biomass but reduced the mycorrhizal colonization of maize compared to the control by more than one third. Biowaste compost increased soil enzyme activities in the P cycling, increased Pmic and slightly decreased the mycorrhizal colonization of maize. Addition of TSP to biowaste compost increased the content of PDL in soil to the level of optimal plant supply. Single TSP supply decreased the ratio of PDL:Pmic to 1:1 from about 4:1 in the control. Decreased plant-benefits from mycorrhizal symbiosis were assumed from decreased mycorrhizal colonization of maize with TSP supply. The undesirable side effects of TSP supply on the microbial P cycling can be alleviated by the use of compost. Thus, it can be concluded that the plant-availability of P from soil amendments is controlled by the amendment-specific microbial P cycling and, likely, P transfer to plants. Peine et al.

210e3f7e-bf7e-44f3-9c14-49d4c0068f0d,P desorption kinetics from Fe- and Al-hydroxides,P desorption kinetics from Fe- and Al-hydroxides   .,"The synthetic commercially hydroxides were goethite (99%, Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, Massachusetts, USA), and gibbsite (Merck Millipore, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), which were of analytical grade. 2-line-ferrihydrite was prepared, at which a 1 M KOH was added to 500 ml of a 0.2 M Fe(NO3)3 ∙ 9 H2O-solution, until a pH of 7.5 was reached. The developed precipitate was centrifuged and washed for 5 min at 12134 x G, subsequently frozen, freeze-dried, and stored in a desiccator. The mixed Fe-Al-hydroxides were prepared by mixing 0.1 M Fe(NO3)3 ∙ 9 H2O and 0,1 M Al(NO3)3 ∙ 9 H2O were mixed in molar ratios of 1:0, 10:1, 5:1. 1:1, 1:5, 1:10 and 0:1, and brought to a pH of 6 with 5 M KOH. After equilibration for 1 h, the precipitate was centrifuged for 5 min at 12134 x G, washed with ultrapure water, dried at 60°C, and ground into a powder. The elemental composition of the adsorbents was verified using SEM-EDX, scanning electron microscopy (DSM 962, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (X-Max 50 mm² with INCA, Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, Great Britain). The final resulting mineral phase of pure Al(OH)3 and FeO(OH) for the amorphous hydroxides was identified. Determination of the minerals crystallization as well as amorphous structures were verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), using an Empyrean powder diffractometer (PANalytical, Almelo, Netherlands), with a theta-theta-goniometer, Cu-Kα radiation (λ=0.15418 nm), automatic divergent and anti-scatter slits and a PIXcel3D detector. Diffraction data were recorded from 4.6° to 84.9° 2ϴ with a step-size of 0.0131, a step time of 58.4 s, and generator settings of 40 kV and 40 mA. Prior to desorption, the hydroxides were coated on silica sand (particle size 0.2 – 0.8 mm, Merck Millipore) to ensure a similar sample treatment (e.g. centrifugation times and revolutions). The silica sand used was finely granulated, washed, and calcined. 10 g of the hydroxide in a 0.01 M NaNO3-solution were adjusted to pH 6, resulting in a final volume of 100 ml. 100 g of pure silica sand was added to the suspension, and shaken for 24 h at room temperature. The supernatant was decanted and the material was washed three to five times with the 0.01 M NaNO3-solution at pH 6, and in a final step with ultrapure water to remove hydroxide traces and soluble salts. The coated silica sand was oven dried at 60°C for 48 h. The silica-hydroxide mixtures were preload with P. Therefore, 200 ml of a 2 mmol l-1 KH2PO4 solution and a 0.01 M CaCl2 background solution were added to the mixtures. After shaking horizontally for 24 h at 150 motions min-1, the hydroxides were centrifuged for 5 min at 929 x G. The supernatant was filtrated and the adsorbed P concentration determined Desorption experiments were conducted with CaCl2, CaSO4, humic acid, and citric acid, adjusted to pH 6. 2.5 g of the coated silica sand was treated with 50 ml of 0.01 M CaCl2 or 0.01 M CaSO4. 5 g of the coated silica sand was used for desorption with 50 ml of 2 g l-1 humic acid and citric acid (Alfa Aesar). A concentration of 2 g l-1 for both humic and citric acid was selected to provide a concentration similar to that of the CaCl2 and CaSO4. For desorption experiments, treatment solutions were added to the samples, shaken at 150 motions min-1, and centrifuged for 15 min at 2091 x g. After this, the supernatant was filtered for measurement of P. The time steps were 2, 6, 24, 48, 168, 336, 672, and 1344 h.

e2d7a740-8c6e-4fc1-92db-21bf6d95cd0d,Normalized FT-IR-spectra of pH-dependend phosphorus adsorption on goethite,Normalized FT-IR-spectra of pH-dependend phosphorus adsorption on goethite.,"P adsorption was investigated on synthetic and commercially available goethite (99 %, Alfa Aesar). The composition and crystallinity was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analyses with an Empyrean powder diffractometer (PANalytical) with Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15418 nm). The determination of the d-values and the verification of the calculated lattice parameter were performed using the XPowder software. The specific surface area of 17.2 m2 g-1 was determined with an Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome) using a five-point BET measurement and N2. The point of zero charge (PZC) was determined using potentiometric titration, which was 8.8 for pure goethite without adsorbed P. P adsorption on goethite was studied in a batch setup at the pH values of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Therefore, goethite sample material (5 g) for the respective pH steps was adjusted to pH 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12, respectively, in ultrapure water with 0.01 M HCl (pH 4), or 0.1 M to 5 M KOH (pH 6 to 12) using a Potentiometric Compact Titrator G20S and combined DGi115-SC pH electrode (Mettler-Toledeo) under continuous stirring. For P adsorption, 0.5 g of goethite and 40 ml of a 0.15 mmol l-1 KH2PO4, solution, adjusted to pH 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 as well, were mixed to achieve a solid-solution ratio of 1:80. The goethite- KH2PO4 mixture was shaken horizontally at 150 motions min-1 for 24 h. The P concentration in the solution was determined after reaction times of 2, 24, 48, and 168 h. The samples have been centrifuged for 15 min at 3500 rpm and the clear supernatant was filtrated by using P-poor Whatmann 512 ½ filters. The concentrations of P and Fe were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Under real conditions in the soil, an influence of the P sorption on the pH is to be expected. Therefore, the pH change was taken into account both at the beginning and at the end of the adsorption experiments. The pH change was measured in a reference experiment that was treated exactly under the same conditions as P adsorption experiment. The amount of adsorbed P was referred to both the initial and the final pH. For FT-IR spectroscopic measurements, the solid goethite samples after an adsorption time of 2 and 168 h were dried for 24 h at 40°C, and stored in a desiccator. The samples were analyzed without further treatment prior to FT-IR measurements. IR spectroscopic analyses were carried out by measurement of the absorbance in the FT-IR Drift mode (Tensor 27 HTS-XT, Bruker) and a wavenumber range from 400 to 4000 cm-1. The spectrum of each treatment was created by generate the average of the 2 replicated samples by using the software Essential FTIR® (Operant LLC), where each sample included 40 scans. For evaluation, all spectra together were truncated in the range 1300 to 800 cm-1, baseline corrected, and normalized with respect to the highest absorbance. After 2 h adsorption time, the amount of adsorbed P was 0.52 µmol m-2 at pH 4, 0.65 µmol m-2 for pH 6, 0.58 µmol m-2 for pH 8, 0.29 µmol m-2 for pH 10, and 0.14 µmol m-2 for pH 12. Considering the initial pH, P adsorption on goethite after an adsorption time of 168 h was highest for pH 8, yielding a P surface coverage of 0.75 µmol m-2 after a reaction time of 168 h, followed by pH 6 with 0.72 µmol m-2, and pH 4 with 0.68 µmol m-2. The extent of adsorption decreased from pH 8 to 10 with 0.58 µmol m-2 and was lowest for pH 12 with 0.18 µmol m-2. The solution pH decreased for the initial pH 4 to 3.9., and for the initial pH of 6, the final pH was 5.0. For initial pH values 8.0 and 10.0, the corresponding final pH values were 6.7 and 7.6, respectively. At initial pH 12.0, the decrease of the solution pH weakened with a final pH of 11.6.

2eed3d66-84cd-4dd0-bce5-e4fa1560af7a,"P release kinetics from vivianite, hydroxyapatite and bone char","P release kinetics from vivianite, hydroxyapatite and bone char.","The bone char used for P release experiments was produced by Bonechar Carvão Ativado Do Brasil Ltda. (Maringá, Brazil) in 2015. It has been manufactured by pyrolysis of rendered (de-fatted) bovine bones at more than 800°C. A particle size analysis of the bone char was carried out, whereby 100 g of char was divided into three particle size fractions: 200 µm, 200 - 2000 µm, and 2000 µm. The P bearing minerals used were the commercially available Ca-phosphate hydroxyapatite (Ca5[OH(PO4)3]) (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) and the Fe-phosphate vivianite (Fe32+[PO4]2 · 8H2O). Vivianite was prepared where 250 ml of a 0.035 M H3PO4-solution were added to solid FeSO4. The resulting 0.05 M FeSO4-solution was adjusted to pH 6 with 5 M KOH. The precipitate formed was centrifuged for 5 min at 2090 × G and washed with ultrapure water. The prepared vivianite was dried at 40°C and ground into powder using mortar and pestle. P, Ca, and Fe were determined using ICP-AES after pressure digestion or aqua regia digestion. The composition of hydroxyapatite and vivianite was verified using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area was determined with an Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome, Odelzhausen, Germany) using a multi-point BET-measurement (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) and N2 as adsorptive medium. The specific surface area of hydroxyapatite was with 68.4 m² g-1 1.7 fold higher than for vivianite with 39.5 m² g-1. Bone char had the highest specific surface area with values in the range from 92.1 to 94.8 m² g-1, increasing with decreasing particle size. P release experiments were conducted in triplicate by using a batch setup with an initial pH of 6. For this, 2.5 g of the bone char and the phosphate minerals were weighed into PE bottles. Batch solubilization experiments were performed with CaCl2 (Merck Millipore) and citric acid with the formula C6H8O7 (99 %, Alfa Aesar), adjusted to pH 6 with KOH. These reaction solutions were used in concentrations 0.01 M, 0.05 M, and 0.1 M, respectively. 50 ml reaction solution was added to the bone char samples and 40 ml was added to hydroxyapatite and vivianite samples, respectively. The samples were shaken on a horizontal shaker for 24 h at 200 motions min-1, centrifuged for 15 min at 2090 × G, and the supernatant was filtrated by using P-poor Whatman 512 1/2 filters. Following, fresh reaction solution was added to the samples. Samples for P measurement were taken after 2, 6, 24, 48, and 168 h. The cumulative P release based on 168 h with CaCl2 is very low for all used materials. While the total P release for bone char was close to the detection limit, minor P concentrations were measured for vivianite and hydroxyapatite, which increased slightly with increasing CaCl2 concentration. The use of citric acid enabled significantly more P to be solved, whereby an increase of dissolved P with increasing citric acid concentration was measured as well. At low citric acid concentration of 0.01 M, the lowest amount of P was released from bone char, where most P was released from the smallest particle fraction. In total, most P was released from hydroxyapatite after 168 hours.

90722934-7e78-45ef-b620-60b4cee02a6c,Catch crop rooting behaviour 1st crop rotation cycle,Catch crop rooting behaviour 1st crop rotation cycle.,"A central aspect when including catch crops into a crop rotation is the conservation of nutrients in their biomass for the subsequently grown crop. Numerous studies have been made evaluating the above-ground nutrient scavenging potential of different catch crop species. Often it was thereby described, that mixtures yield higher biomasses than pure stands of catch crops. An assumption is the ecological concept of niche differentiation: Higher biomass production in mixtures might rely on vertical root niche differentiation in the soil resulting in overall better nutrient exploitation when species with different root system distribution and nutrient uptake abilities are cultivated together. However, due to the general difficulty of root biomass quantification in soil samples paired with the even more challenging question of assigning root masses to different species, studies proving this niche differentiation concept are rare. In the past years DNA-based techniques were more and more used for species discrimination in soil samples, but root biomass quantification remains difficult. We therefore developed a method for root biomass quantification of different species in soil samples: Using species-specific primers on the non-conserved ITS1 or ITS2 region species discrimination could be made based on root DNA. In the following, a qPCR-based quantification step with species-specific standard curves for cycle threshold values at known root weight was used to quantify the vertical root biomass distribution of different catch crop species in soil cores up to 90 cm depth in pure stands vs. a mixture. Test objects were the four species mustard (Sinapis alba), phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia), bristle oat (Avena strigosa) and Egyptian clover (Trifolium alexandrinum), either grown in pure stands or in a 4-species mixture. Their vertical root system distribution was evaluated in soil cores with 7 cm diameter obtained from two sites in Germany (Asendorf - Lower Saxony and Triesdorf - Bavaria), and at two initial starting points of the respective wheat-catch crop-maize long-term rotation (2015 and 2016) - in total 4 test environments. Repeatedly at both sites and in both years, mustard and phacelia developed the deepest root systems (usually until 80 cm depths), followed by oat reaching site-specifically between 50 and 60 cm depth and clover being only able to root 20-30 cm deep after 2.5 months of cultivation. Oat or mustard developed site-specifically the largest root systems in Asendorf or Triesdorf, respectively among the pure stands. Although the individual-species seeding rates were lower in the mixed stand compared to the respective pure stands, mustard and phacelia developed similar root biomass under both conditions. Against this, the other two slower developing species were strongly repressed in root biomass formation in the mix. In total, the mix often developed the largest root biomass among all variants. The nutrient accumulation of the different catch crop species has been already published under “Catch crop nutrient uptake 1st crop rotation cycle”.","Boden, Landwirtschaftliche Nutzung, Bodenbedeckung, Bodennutzung, Verteilung der Arten, Avena nuda, Poaceae, Sinapis alba, Phacelia tanacetifolia, Trifolium alexandrinum, Catch cropping, Crop rotation, cropping systems, Catch crops, Soil biology, Root cap, Roots, biomass, DNA, DNA sequence, Biological competition, Interspecific competition, Plant competition, Catch crop species, Root biomass distribution, Root biomass quantification, ITS region, vertical root niche differentiation, Boden, opendata",2019-01-15,BonaRes Data Centre,English,True

The sites are characterized by a defined, comparable and traceable cultivation history (see Mahnkopp et al. 2018). At the sites 4 plots were repeatedly re-planted with apples to induce ARD. Plots with grass cover served as a control. The soil was brought from the reference sites to Hannover for a bio test. There, in vitro propagated apple plants were planted in untreated (ut) or irradiated (G) ARD (A) or grass soil (G). After 8 weeks of cultivation the roots were examined microscopically for mycorrhiza colonization.","Vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae, Symbionts, Endomycorrhizae, Apples, Root colonization, Soil, Boden, Mykorrhiza, Obstbaum, Wurzel, Besiedlung, Boden, opendata",2020-07-16,BonaRes Data Centre,English,True
9d477f07-9206-425d-bc3f-7d9c18b5f0a2,Soil Bacterial Community Chronosequence Jülich,Soil Bacterial Community Chronosequence Jülich     .,"Over 100 km² of agricultural soils have been restored after open-cast lignite mining in the area between Aachen, Cologne and Düsseldorf (Germany). The applied restoration technique leads to a massive soil disturbance in three ways: soil structure is lost by excavation and mixing; topsoil is diluted with subsoil and loess parent material, raising pH and lowering organic carbon content; soil biology is reduced. This data set contains data on the bacterial community composition along a pseudo-chronosequence of recultivated soils after open-cast mining and one naturally grown Luvisol (original soil), which was never influenced by mining. Soils between 2016 and 2011 were managed by farmers of the mining company RWE AG (Germany). Soils between 2006 and 1964, as well as the original soil, were managed by local farmers. Farmers of conventional agricultural management followed the guidelines and recommendations of the German Federal Soil Protection Act. Farmers used official agricultural services like the chamber of agriculture to comply with the German fertilization regulation and good professional practice of plant protection. Soil parameters were determined on basis of standardized VDLUFA and DIN guidelines and those data are available on the BonaRes Data Server (INPLAMINT.Nutrient.Status.Field.Experiment.Chronosequence: https://maps.bonares.de/mapapps/resources/apps/bonares/index.html?lang=en&doi=72ca6e98-5aab-4884-bf1b-56931482eb94). Soil water content ranged between 20 and 24% soil dry weight in March and June, except the freshly deposed soil substrate of 2016. Soil texture was generally silty loam. pH measured in CaCl2 ranged between 7.4 and 7.9, except in the original Luvisol with pH of 6.4. Only recultivated soils contained inorganic C in form of CaCO3. The bacterial abundance was determined using quantitative real-time PCR of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (FP: 5′-GGTAGTCYAYGCMSTAAACG-3′, RP: 5′-GACARCCATGCASCACCTG-3′). The bacterial community structure of 10 sites with 4 pseudo-replicates was characterised by amplicon sequencing of the V1-V2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using primers 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGC-3′) and 357R (5'-CTGCTGCCTYCCGTA-3'). Results show that bacterial abundance as well as alpha-diversity quickly recovers to levels of the original soil. However, the bacterial community structure is strongly changed even 52 years after site restoration. Furthermore, it was observed that the bacterial community structure shifts depending on land use changes and weathering of the initial soil substrate happening during the restoration procedures.

54ecbb64-7cc4-46d2-957d-d37e957daf98,Soil phosphorus contents in a loamy soil based on the distribution of flux fields,Soil phosphorus contents in a loamy soil based on the distribution of flux fields.,"Heterogenous flow pathways through the soil are a major component in the transport of water, dissolved and particle-bound nutrients like phosphorus (P) to water resources, and promote the eutrophication of water bodies. Non-uniform water flow patterns may also influence the spatial variability of the P-content in soils. This study was designed to understand the spatial distribution of P in agriculturally used soils and the mechanism causing P accumulation and depletion at the centimeter scale. We conducted three replicate dye tracer experiments using Brilliant Blue on a loamy Stagnosol in North-Eastern-Germany. The plant-available phosphorus of stained and unstained areas was analyzed using double lactate extraction (DL-P) and diffusive gradients on thin films (DGT-P). The DL-P and the DGT-P were strongly correlated (p0.001, R²=0.63) confirming that DL-P is a good measure for the mobile phase of soil P. The plant available P contents of the topsoil were significantly higher than those of the subsoil in all three replicates. The topsoil’s stained areas showed higher P contents than unstained areas, while the opposite was found for the subsoil. The P contents varied strongly over the soil profiles (0.4 to 11.2 mg P 100 g-1) and different categories of flow patterns (matrix flow, flow fingers, preferential flow and no flow). The P contents of these flow patterns differed significantly from each other and followed the order: Pmatrix flow Pfinger flow Pno flow Ppreferential flow.","Soil, opendata, Boden",2020-02-20,BonaRes Data Centre,English,True
a3505f42-b0e3-4fd1-819a-6effaf8c3a3a,Phosphorus concentrations from a suction plate experiment,Phosphorus concentrations from a suction plate experiment.,"The application of fertilizers to soils may impair the quality of both surface and subsurface waters. Severe rainfall events that follow fertilizer application can increase P release from soils. In this study, suction plates were installed in a loamy soil with the aim of determining the P transport patterns and processes in the soil before and after the application of biogas digestate. Prior to the application of biogas digestate, the pore water concentrations of dissolved reactive P (DRP) were significantly lower than the total P (TP) concentrations, with DRP/TP ratios increasing from 0.03 to 0.89. After fertilizer application, the TP and DRP pore water concentrations increased 400-fold. The DRP/TP ratio remained almost constant at 0.83. After 220 mm of precipitation, 4.5% of the P mass applied was leached to below the 50-cm soil depth, indicating the general mobility of P in soils during high-intensity rainfall. Brilliant Blue dye tracing experiments revealed that organic-matter-rich biogas digestate obviously changes the flow and transport patterns in soils from being homogenous to moderately heterogeneous, including preferential flow. Although the P loading across the flux plane had been equilibrated prior to treatment, after the application it was found to be concentrated in preferred transport regions. The emerging conclusion is that the risk of ground and subsequent surface water pollution with P after fertilization with biogas digestate originates not only from the applied P mass but also from the shift in the flow and transport regime caused by the organic-matter-rich slurry.","Soil, opendata, Boden, phosphorus, organic fertiliser, soil, soil contamination, soil profile, Boden, inspireidentifiziert",2019-08-19,BonaRes Data Centre,English,True
