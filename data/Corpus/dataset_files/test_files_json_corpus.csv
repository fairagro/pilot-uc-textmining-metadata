Abstract:
Datenmeldung nach dem EGovG. Der Datensatz kann auf Anfrage zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Eine Datennutzungsvereinbarung wird abgeschlossen. Grassland conversion to cropland bears a risk of increased nitrate (NO3−) leaching and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission due to enhanced nitrogen (N) mineralization. This study investigates the dynamics of mineral N and N2O emissions following chemical and mechanical conversion from permanent grassland to cropland (maize) at two sites with different texture (clayey loam and sandy loam) and fertilization regime (with and without mineral N-fertilization) over a two-year period. Soil mineral N levels increased shortly after conversion and remained elevated in converted plots compared to permanent grassland or long-term cropland in the second year of investigation. Fluxes of N2O were higher from converted plots than permanent grassland or cropland. However, soil mineral N contents and cumulative N2O emissions did not differ between conversion types. Only the distribution of N2O losses over the two years differed: while losses were of similar magnitude in both years in mechanically converted plots, the major part of N2O loss in chemically converted plots occurred in the first year after conversion while emissions approximated grassland level in the second year. N2O fluxes were mainly controlled by water-filled pore space and soil NO3− levels. Despite differences in N levels at the two sites, these key findings are similar on both study sites. They indicate strongly accelerated mineralization after conversion, an effect that still lasted in the converted plots at the end of the two-year investigation irrespective of the conversion type used.

 pH-dependency of P adsorption kinetics on goethite
Abstract_text_1: 
 pH-dependency of P adsorption kinetics on goethite .
Abstract_text_2: 
 P adsorption was investigated on synthetic and commercially available goethite (99 %, Alfa Aesar). The composition and crystallinity was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analyses with an Empyrean powder diffractometer (PANalytical) with Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15418 nm). The determination of the d-values and the verification of the calculated lattice parameter were performed using the XPowder software. The specific surface area of 17.2 m2 g-1 was determined with an Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome) using a five-point BET measurement and N2. The point of zero charge (PZC) was determined using potentiometric titration by weighing 0.5 g of goethite into 50 ml PE-tubes and adding of 10 ml of a 0.02 M, 0.2 M, and 2 M KCl solution, respectively. The KCl solutions were diluted with ultrapure water to a total volume of 20 ml, leading to final concentrations of 0.01 M, 0.1 M, and 1 M, respectively. After closing the tubes, the samples were equilibrated for 4 days at 25°C to reach an equilibration pH value. Following, the suspension was titrated with 0.1 M KOH, and the pH was recorded after each addition of KOH as a function of the volume. A similar procedure was used for the blank solutions. The adsorbed amounts of H+ or OH- were calculated from the amount of KOH added to the samples minus the amount of KOH used by blank titration. The titration curves of the three different concentration steps intersect at the PZC, which was 8.8 for pure goethite without adsorbed P. P adsorption on goethite was studied in a batch setup at the pH values of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Therefore, goethite sample material (5 g) for the respective pH steps was adjusted to pH 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12, respectively, in ultrapure water with 0.01 M HCl (pH 4), or 0.1 M to 5 M KOH (pH 6 to 12) using a Potentiometric Compact Titrator G20S and combined DGi115-SC pH electrode (Mettler-Toledeo) under continuous stirring. For P adsorption, 0.5 g of goethite and 40 ml of a 0.15 mmol l-1 KH2PO4, solution, adjusted to pH 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 as well, were mixed to achieve a solid-solution ratio of 1:80. The goethite- KH2PO4 mixture was shaken horizontally at 150 motions min-1 for 24 h. The P concentration in the solution was determined after reaction times of 2, 24, 48, and 168 h. The samples have been centrifuged for 15 min at 3500 rpm and the clear supernatant was filtrated by using P-poor Whatmann 512 ½ filters. The concentrations of P and Fe were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The adsorption experiments were done in duplicate. Under real conditions in the soil, an influence of the P sorption on the pH is to be expected. Therefore, the pH change was taken into account both at the beginning and at the end of the adsorption experiments. The pH change was measured in a reference experiment that was treated exactly under the same conditions as P adsorption experiment. The amount of adsorbed P was referred to both the initial and the final pH. Considering the initial pH, P adsorption on goethite was highest for pH 8, yielding a P surface coverage of 0.75 µmol m-2 after a reaction time of 168 h, followed by pH 6 with 0.72 µmol m-2, and pH 4 with 0.68 µmol m-2. The extent of adsorption decreased from pH 8 to 10 with 0.58 µmol m-2 and was lowest for pH 12 with 0.18 µmol m-2. The solution pH decreased for the initial pH 4 to 3.9., and for the initial pH of 6, the final pH was 5.0. For initial pH values 8.0 and 10.0, the corresponding final pH values were 6.7 and 7.6, respectively. At initial pH 12.0, the decrease of the solution pH weakened with a final pH of 11.6. Research domain: Soil Sciences Research question: How does the solution-pH affect the amount of adsorbed phosphorus on the goethite surface?

PAH-Metaboliten in Fischen aus der Nord- und Ostsee (2018)

Abstract:
Polyaromatische Kohlenwasserstoffe (PAH) sind Bestandteil fossiler Energieträger und haben natürliche und anthropogene Quellen. Man findet sie in der Umwelt zum Beispiel in der Nähe von Häfen oder Schifffahrtsrouten. Zur Gruppe der PAH gehören auch krebserregende Substanzen. Fische metabolisieren PAH sehr schnell, so dass PAH selbst in Fischen kaum nachweisbar sind, wohl aber ihre Metaboliten in der Galle des Fisches. Die Gehalte von PAK-Metaboliten in Meeresfisch werden im Rahmen des Umwelt-Monitorings des Thünen-Instituts für Fischereiökologie regelmäßig überwacht, um die Höhe der PAK-Belastung indirekt zu erfassen und zu bewerten sowie regionale und zeitliche Unterschiede in dieser Belastung festzustellen.

Dataset of a Germany-wide field study assessing honey bee colony development, brood development, and floral nectar as well as gut microbiomes under fungicide exposure and pollen restriction in 2022

Abstract:
The data set contains the corresponding raw data from the publication: Wueppenhorst et a. (2024). Honey bee colonies can buffer short-term stressor effects of pollen restriction and fungicide exposure on colony development and the microbiome (DOI: 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116723). A total of 128 honey bee colonies were subjected to a Germany-wide field trial, during which they were exposed to combined stressors, namely fungicide exposure and pollen restriction, from April 2022 to April 2023. The parameters of colony development and brood development were recorded over the course of the bee season, while microbiome data was collected during the treatment phase. Colony population estimates were conducted at three-week intervals, commencing with the blooming of the oilseed rape field. Brood assessment was performed during the treatment phase, with the first brood cycle. In-hive bees and forager bees were collected before, during, and after the treatment phase, and their gut microbiomes were analyzed for abundances of five core species. Additionally, plant flowers of the oilseed rape were collected and analyzed for nectar-inhabiting yeast species. All parameters can be found in separate data tables accompanied by an explanatory metadata file. Dataset comprises of five individual data tables a) Data of honey bee colony assessments from spring to autumn 2022 (Population_data.xlsx), b) Data of honey bee overwintering success (Overwintering_Data.xlsx), c) Data of honey bee brood assessment of the first brood cycle within treatment period (Brood_Data.xlsx), d) qPCR data to determine the core microbiome bacterial abundances (Microbiome_Data.xlsx), e) Data of nectar yeast abundances of rape seed flowers (Nectaryeast_Data.xlsx). Further information about the experimental setup can be found in the corresponding publication (doi: 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116723).

 Determination of spider mite abundance in soil of field-grown cucumbers and in plants under predatory mite pressure in invasive infestations using HRM real-time PCR assay (Part 2 of data collection, table KERSTEN_ET_AL_DATA_FIG5).
Abstract_text_2: 
 Between 2017 and 2019 we studied the abundance of spider mites in the soil to estimate the potential infestation pressure of soil colonizing spider mites. The spider mites were heterogeneously distributed in small concentrations in the soil. Soil colonizing spider mites did not affect spider mite abundance on plants and reversed. We observed that spider mite migration occurred primarily from the edge of the field adjacent to the weed strip. In 2020 and 2021, we investigated the efficacy of the predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) for suppressing spider mite hotspots in the cropland. We compared untreated spider mite hotspots with N. californicus treated hotspots and showed that a single release of predatory mites could result in a high level of control when spider mite infestation density was initially high. With this study, soil can be ruled out as a habitat for spider mites, and attention to spider mite pest control can be directed to plant infestations. The highly sensitive HRM real-time PCR assay was used for the quantification of the spider mites. Tetranychus urticae served as reference. Research domain: Soil Sciences Research question: Does the soil serve as a shelter for spider mites and must the soil be included in control strategies? Does invasive infestation by spider mites occur on crops starting from the soil? Can the targeted use of predatory mites contain spider mite hotspots? table KERSTEN_ET_AL_DATA_FIG5: Spider mite abundance in the phyllosphere and soil of an open field cucumber cultivation. Plot dimensions were 500 m long and 30 m wide included 19 plants rows and 6 transects. Three to five leaves and two soil samples were collected at one sampling point and merged together for analysis.

Abstract:
Die hier hinterlegten Daten beziehen sich auf die Publikation von Forschungsergebnissen aus dem Verbundvorhaben „Abundanz und Vielfalt von Clostridium in landwirtschaftlichen Biogasanlagen unter besonderer Berücksichtigung von Clostridium botulinum“. In diesem Zusammenhang wurden Proben aus niedersächsischen landwirtschaftlichen Biogasanlagen in Hinblick auf die Zusammensetzung und Abundanz der mikrobiellen Lebensgemeinschaften (Bakterien und Archaeen) untersucht und dabei ein möglicher Zusammenhang mit den eingesetzten organischen Substraten, den Prozessparametern und den Nährstoffen untersucht. Die Abundanz von Bakterien und Archaeen wurde mit Hilfe der quantitativen PCR von 16S rRNA Genen kultivierungsunabhängig aus DNA der vergärenden Substrate bestimmt und die Vielfalt über DNA-Sequenzierungen der 16S rRNA Gene mit Hilfe der Illumina MiSeq Technologie ermittelt. Insgesamt reicht der vorhandene Datensatz von neun Biogasanlagen nicht aus, um alleinstehend einen belastbaren Zusammenhang zwischen den mikrobiologischen und den abiotischen Parametern abzuleiten. Hinweise auf ein mögliches Vorkommen von C. botulinum ergaben sich nicht. Der Datensatz kann jedoch einen Beitrag leisten, in einem größeren Kontext mit weiteren Beprobungen von Biogasanlagen ein besseres Verständnis über den Einfluss von Gärsubstraten und Prozessbedingungen auf die Zusammensetzung des Mikrobioms in Biogasanlagen zu gewinnen.

 Westerfeld: Long-term field trial on tillage and fertilization in crop rotation - PLOT.
Abstract_text_2: 
 The long-term field trial started 1992 in Bernburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany (51°82' N, 11°70', 138 m above sea level). The soil is a loess chernozem over limestone with an effective rooting depth of 100 cm, containing 22% clay, 70% silt and 8% sand in the ploughed upper (Ap) horizon. It has a neutral pH (7.0–7.4) and an appropriate P and K supply (45–70 mg kg-1 and 130–185 mg kg-1 in calcium-acetate-lactate extract, respectively). The 1980–2010 annual average temperature was 9.7°C, and the average annual precipitation was 511 mm. On five large parcels in strip split plot design (1.2 ha each, main plots) the individual crops grain maize (Zea mays), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum), winter barley (Hordeum vulgare), winter rapeseed (Brassica napus ssp. napus), and winter wheat are rotated on the main plots and grown in parallel. All crop residues remain on the fields. Conservation tillage with a cultivator (CT; 10 cm flat non-inversion soil loosening) is compared to sub-plots with conventional tillage (MP; mould-board plough, carrier board with combined alternating ploughshares, ploughing depth 30 cm, incl. soil inversion). The differentially managed soils are either intensively (Int) operated according to usual practice regarding N supply and pesticide application or extensively managed (Ext) with reduced N supply, without fungicides, and growth regulators. The climate data are not included in the data set. They can be downloaded via the DWD's Open Data Server because there is a DWD weather station (ID 00445) in Bernburg-Strenzfeld.

PAH-Metaboliten in Fischen aus der Nord- und Ostsee (2017)

Abstract:
Polyaromatische Kohlenwasserstoffe (PAH) sind Bestandteil fossiler Energieträger und haben natürliche und anthropogene Quellen. Man findet sie in der Umwelt zum Beispiel in der Nähe von Häfen oder Schifffahrtsrouten. Zur Gruppe der PAH gehören auch krebserregende Substanzen. Fische metabolisieren PAH sehr schnell, so dass PAH selbst in Fischen kaum nachweisbar sind, wohl aber ihre Metaboliten in der Galle des Fisches. Die Gehalte von PAK-Metaboliten in Meeresfisch werden im Rahmen des Umwelt-Monitorings des Thünen-Instituts für Fischereiökologie regelmäßig überwacht, um die Höhe der PAK-Belastung indirekt zu erfassen und zu bewerten sowie regionale und zeitliche Unterschiede in dieser Belastung festzustellen.

 Collection of root exudates of lettuce grown for nine weeks in soils from three long-term field experiments (Data collection).
Abstract_text_2: 
 We conducted a minirhizotron experiment with soil samples taken in 2016 from the field sites of three long-term experiments, belonging to the Humboldt- Universität zu Berlin (HUB; Thyrow) and the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FIBL; Therwil) and the LTE in Bernburg (Anhalt-University). The soil, which underwent different fertilization strategies (mineral vs. organic and biodynamic fertilization vs. reduced and full N-fertilization) and cultivation practices (plough vs. cultivator) was used to cultivate lettuce as model plant in minirhizotrons for 9 weeks under controlled growth chamber experiments at the IGZ-Großbeeren. The experiment was established to study the different effects of fertilization management and soil cultivation on the yet unknown interactions of rhizodeposits and rhizosphere chemistry with its associated rhizosphere soil microbiota (fungal, bacterial and archaeal communities) and their impact on plant health and stress resilience in lettuce. Samples of the rhizosphere soil solution were collected with moist sorption filters (5 mm Ø, filter paper: MN815, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) placed onto the surface of lateral roots growing along the root observation window. Micro-sampling was conducted six weeks after sowing during vegetative growth of the lettuce plants, to account for most active carbohydrate partitioning to the roots and high root exudation during this phase. For each minirhizotron, rhizosphere sampling was conducted with two 5 mm sorption filters (equivalent to 1 cm root length), applied in triplicate in subapical root zones (1–2 cm behind the root tip) and basal root zones (older, mature parts of the root system, 8–9 cm behind the root tip). As a control, sampling was performed in soil zones without visible root development (soil without root contact). Samples for each minirhizotron were pooled after an incubation time of 4 h and kept frozen at minus 20°C. releated paper Windisch, Saskia; Sommermann, Loreen; Babin, Doreen; Chowdhury, Soumitra Paul; Grosch, Rita; Moradtalab, Narges et al.

Local and landscape environmental heterogeneity drive ant community structure in temperate semi-natural upland grasslands

Abstract:
Environmental heterogeneity is an important driver of ecological communities. Here, we assessed the effects of local and landscape spatial environmental heterogeneity on ant community structure in temperate semi-natural upland grasslands of Central Germany. We surveyed 33 grassland sites representing a gradient in elevation and landscape composition. Local environmental heterogeneity was measured in terms of variability of temperature and moisture within and between grassland sites. Grassland management type (pasture vs. meadows) was additionally included as a local environmental heterogeneity measure. The complexity of habitat types in the surroundings of grassland sites was used as a measure of landscape environmental heterogeneity. As descriptors of ant community structure, we considered species composition, community evenness, and functional response traits. We found that extensively grazed pastures and within-site heterogeneity in soil moisture at local scale, and a high diversity of land cover types at the landscape scale affected ant species composition by promoting nest densities. Ant community evenness was high in wetter grasslands with low within-site variability in soil moisture and surrounded by a less diverse landscape. Fourth-corner models revealed that ant community structure response to environmental heterogeneity was mediated mainly by worker size, colony size, and life history traits related with colony reproduction and foundation. We discuss how withinsite local variability in soil moisture and low-intensity grazing promote ant species densities, and highlight the role of habitat temperature and humidity in affecting community evenness. We hypothesize that a higher diversity of land cover types in a forest-dominated landscape buffers less favorable environmental conditions for ant species establishment and dispersal between grasslands. We conclude that spatial environmental heterogeneity at local and landscape scales plays an important role as a deterministic force in filtering ant species and, along with neutral processes (e.g. stochastic colonization), in shaping ant community structure in temperate semi-natural upland grasslands.

Genome sequence of a European D. coronariae strain

Abstract:
The fungal pathogen Diplocarpon coronariae, the causal agent of apple blotch, poses a significant challenge in organic apple production and meadow orchards across Europe. One potential measure to restrict the spread of the disease is cultivating resistant varieties. However, understanding the reproduction and pathogenicity of the fungus is crucial for maintaining apple resistance. The recently sequenced Chinese isolate NL1 indicates that secondary metabolites play a role in host colonization. Furthermore, the rapid adaptation of the fungus to environmental conditions, including resistance, depends on sexual reproduction. While the fungus is capable of reproducing both sexually and asexually, in Europe, only asexual reproduction has been observed. The presence of alternative forms (idiomorphs) plays a crucial role in the mating of heterothallic fungi like D. coronariae. Chinese strains have been observed to exhibit the presence of two idiomorphs (MAT1.1 and MAT1.2). At present, no sequence of a European isolate is available for analysis. This study provides the first European draft genome sequence of the D. coronariae strain (DC1_JKI) from Dresden, Germany. The final draft contained 22 scaffolds with a total length of 51.5 Mbp and an N50 of 4.0 Mbp. The BUSCO analysis of genome completeness was 98.5%. Additionally, a second isolate from Japan (NBRC 30405) was sequenced for comparison of the genome. Using long-read sequencing technologies, the DNA from DC1_JKI and NBRC 30405 was sequenced using Oxford Nanopore MinION. To polish the sequences, Illumina NovaSeq sequencing (NovaSeq 6000 S4 PE150 XP) was conducted for short reads. The draft genome sequence was assembled using Canu software, resulting in the genome sequence of DC1_JKI. The data on this platform comprise 20 files. Two genome sequences have been processed. The European assembly is available in the file ""genome_DC1_JKI.fasta"" and the Japanese assembly in ""genome_NBRC30405.fasta"". The final European genome sequence was first annotated using BRAKER 1 and BRAKER 2 and the masked genome sequence, detected repetitive elements, genome annotation features, protein sequences and coding sequences are available from this collection (genome.fa.masked.gz, genome.fa.out.gz, genome.fa.tbl.gz, Diplocarpon_coronariae-families.fa.gz, Diplocarpon_coronariae-families.stk.gz, Br2_tsebra.gtf.gz, Br2_tsebra.aa.gz, Br2_tsebra.codingseq.gz). The functional annotation of was performed with InterProScan (interproscan.tsv.gz; interproscan.gff3.gz). GeMoMa pipeline was used to predict gene models using three reference datasets from species of the genus Drepanopezizaceae and two species of the order Helotiales in combination with the incorporation of the annotation from BRAKER1 and BRAKER 2. Finally the protein sequences (Galaxy32-[GeMoMa_NBRC30405_canu].fasta, Galaxy18-[GeMoMa_DC1_JKI].fasta) and the genome annotation features (Galaxy31-[GeMoMa_NBRC30405_canu].gff, Galaxy17-[GeMoMa_DC1_JKI].gff) are available from this data collection for both genome sequences. Additionally, the genomic sequences from the mitochondria of both isolates D. coronariae from Dresden (DC1_JKI) and Japan (NBRC 30405) are provided (tig00000019_Mito_DC1_JKI.fa, GeSeqJob-20240105-133611_tig00000019_Mito_DC1_JKI.gff3, tig00000344_Mito_NBTC30405.fa, GeSeqJob-20240105-134830_tig00000344_Mito_NBRC30405.gff3).

Abstract_text_2: 
 This dataset provides detailed information about 205 Long-term Field Experiments (LTFE) in Germany. The research was done in the context of the funding initiative of the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) 'BonaRes' (www.bonares.de). LTFE here are defined as agricultural field experiments with the minimum duration of 20 years, a static design and research in the context of bioeconomy. Experiments with a duration of less than 20 years but reaching this age during the BonaRes funding period (2015-2024) are considered as LTFE as well. Information about duration, research theme, holding institution, research parameters, location, landuse category, membership in networks, size and experimental setup are provided. In addition BonaRes performed a classification of the experiments and assigned them to five soil functions. The classification was done according to our knowledge about the data which was collected in the respective LTFE up to now. The following five soil functions were chosen as most relevant for BonaRes: biomass production, storage and filtering of water, storage and recycling of nutrients, carbon storage, habitat for biological activity.

Explosives leaking from dumped munition contaminate fish from German coastal waters – a cause for chronic effects?

Abstract:
Conventional munition dumped into the North Sea and the Baltic Sea close to the German coastline is corroding. A major concern is that biota, including fish, are negatively affected by toxic explosives leaking into marine environments. With the present study, we investigated fish living in close proximity to munition dumping sites for contamination and for signs of health impairments. The flat fish species common dab (Limanda limanda) was used as a model, since it lives in the vicinity of dumping sites and exhibits minor migratory activity. Since explosives are excreted via the bile, the bile fluids from dab were analyzed. Further on we inspected the health status of the fish. Indeed, dab caught in German coastal waters of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea were contaminated with explosives. Probably due to rapid metabolization, concentrations of the explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) were always below limit of detection, but its metabolites 2-amino-4,6-dinitrolouene and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrolouene were detected in bile fluid up to 26.36 ng/ml and 95.91 ng/ml respectively. Only few fish from the Baltic Sea were positive for the explosive HMX, octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine with a maximum concentration of 0.89 ng/ml. Highest concentrations of TNT metabolites in bile fluid were detected in dab collected near the dumping site “Kolberger Heide” in the bay of Kiel (Baltic Sea). However, also dab from the North Sea were significantly contaminated with TNT-metabolites. The present study showed for the first time that fish living close to near shore munition dumping sites in the North Sea are contaminated with explosives. Various health indicators (body condition factors, externally visible fish diseases, parasites or liver anomalies) showed differences in health status between fish living in the North Sea and in the Baltic Sea respectively. However, the health status of fish caught at the most contaminated site in the Baltic Sea was not worse compared to fish living in less contaminated areas. We conclude that fish living in the vicinity of dumping sites in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea can be significantly contaminated with explosives. However, obvious health impairments of the fish were not observed.

 Long-term field trial on tillage and fertilization in crop rotation - Westerfeld.
Abstract_text_2: 
 The long-term field trial started 1992 in Bernburg, Saxony Anhalt, Germany (51°82' N, 11°70', 138 m above sea level). The soil is a loess chernozem over limestone with an effective rooting depth of 100 cm, containing 22% clay, 70% silt and 8% sand in the ploughed upper (Ap) horizon. It has a neutral pH (7.0-7.4) and an appropriate P and K supply (45-70 mg kg-1 and 130-185 mg kg-1 in calcium-acetate-lactate extract, respectively). The 1980 - 2010 annual average temperature was 9.7°C, the average annual precipitation 511 mm. On five large parcels in strip split plot design (1.2 ha each, main plots) the individual crops - grain maize (Zea mays) - winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) - winter barley (Hordeum vulgare) - winter rapeseed (Brassica napus ssp. napus) - winter wheat - are rotated. All crop residues remain on the fields. Conservation tillage cultivator (CT, 10 cm flat non-inversion soil loosening) is compared to sub-plots with conventional tillage (MP; mould-board plough, carrier board with combined alternating ploughshares, ploughing depth 30 cm, incl. soil inversion). The differentially managed soils are either intensively (Int) operated according to usual practice regarding N supply and pesticide application or extensively managed (Ext; reduced N supply, without fungicides and growth regulators).

Abstract_text_1: 
 MODIS fire data (active fire and burned area) from 2003 to 2023 in Yoko and Nanga-Eboko municipalities in the central region of Cameroon.
Abstract_text_2: 
 In this study, we used the monthly time series of medium spatial resolution remote sensing images (2003 to 2023) operated by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. All images were processed on the Google Earth Engine platform (https://code.earthengine.google.com). GEE is a scalable, cloud-based geospatial retrieval and processing platform that offers free in-cloud data access, processing, and administration. The MODIS product used for burned area assessment was from collection 6.1. The images of the burned area (MCD64A1) and active fire (MCD14DL and NRT) were computed from https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MCD64A1 and https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/FIRMS, In this study, over a 20-year study period (2003 to 2023), 252 images were processed at a rate of one image per month for the burned area through the GEE platform when setting up the code. Based on this information, a technique for processing, evaluating, and displaying geodata on forest fires and their consequences was created. The approach consists of four (4) main parts in this study, which are: acquiring and loading input data from publicly available geographic information web services (http://diva-gis.org/datadown)(Step1); pre-processing (filtering) of multi-channel satellite images, computation of indexed images (Step2); thresholding and saving the original data and outcomes in cloud storage (Step3) and then exportation in GIS for geoprocessing (Step3). At the end of the processing, the metadata is composed of data in shapefile format of the monthly and annual burnt areas over the period 2003-2023 as well as those of the active fires. All the data has been re-structured in an Excel file with the appropriate area and number of active points. Description of downloadable files: The single files for burned area mBA[year] contain the characteristics of the fire intensity and the occurrence. mBA[year]_Dissolve contain only one information about the area. The supplemental material contains the statistics of the burned area and active fire.

PAH-Metaboliten in Fischen aus der Nordsee (2021)

Abstract:
Polyaromatische Kohlenwasserstoffe (PAH) sind Bestandteil fossiler Energieträger und haben natürliche und anthropogene Quellen. Man findet sie in der Umwelt zum Beispiel in der Nähe von Häfen oder Schifffahrtsrouten. Zur Gruppe der PAH gehören auch krebserregende Substanzen. Fische metabolisieren PAH sehr schnell, so dass PAH selbst in Fischen kaum nachweisbar sind, wohl aber ihre Metaboliten in der Galle des Fisches. Die Gehalte von PAK-Metaboliten in Meeresfisch werden im Rahmen des Umwelt-Monitorings des Thünen-Instituts für Fischereiökologie regelmäßig überwacht, um die Höhe der PAK-Belastung indirekt zu erfassen und zu bewerten sowie regionale und zeitliche Unterschiede in dieser Belastung festzustellen. Die Ergebnisse fließen in nationale und europäische Umweltbewertungen ein. Die Daten sind Teil des Monitorings im Thünen-Institut für Fischereiökologie und sind als solche über die ICES-Datenbank Dome öffentlich zugänglich.

Historical land use and landscape metrics of grassland EP

Abstract:
The dataset comprises various landscape metrics based on GIS layers derived from historical topographic maps of the 19th and 20th century (ca. 1850, 1930, 1960). Additionally, landscape metrics from 2008 are provided based on modified versions of the biotope layers from the dataset 'Landscape heterogeneity metrics' (BExIS ID 24046). The metrics were calculated on circular buffers around Experimental Plots (EP) with radii of 100, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 m. Further, patch-level metrics and historical land-use/ land-cover type of the grassland sites on which the EP were located are included. The landscape metrics of this dataset are listed below. Patch-level metrics (only for the central patches containing the grassland EP): patch area, perimeter, shape index, nearest-neighbour distance, proximity index and Hanski index. Class-level metrics (calculated for each land use/ land cover class within circular buffers around EP): total class area, proportional class area, mean patch area, area-weighted mean patch area, patch number, total edge, edge density, mean shape index, mean nearest-neighbour distance, median proximity index, median Hanski index. Landscape-level metrics (calculated for the whole landscape within circular buffers around EP): patch density, edge density, Shannon diversity, Shannon evenness. For more information on the landscape metrics, please see the word document ""Metadata_LandMetrics"" that is included in the zip folder of this dataset.

 Effects of alternative P fertilizers on bacterial N and P turnover depend on farm specific conditions - Part 2
Abstract_text_1: 
 Effects of alternative P fertilizers on bacterial N and P turnover depend on farm specific conditions - Part 2.
Abstract_text_2: 
 We investigated the effects of three recycling-derived fertilizers with different P solubility on the capacity-based microbial nutrient turnover. These fertilizers were compared to conventional triple superphosphate (TSP) and no P fertilization (P0). We expected that reduced soil disturbance through deep loosening without soil turning would result in a higher abundance of bacteria involved in N and P turnover and an increased mycorrhizal colonization rate. Soil and rhizosphere samples were taken from two farms (Kiebitzbreite (KB) and Schmatzfelder Breite (SB)) in Central Germany during the 2018/2019 growing season when Triticum aestivum (cultivar Kredo at KB and Julius at SB) was cultivated at both sites. The abundance of microorganisms involved in P and nitrogen (N) turnover was determined using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (gcd, phoD, pitA, pstS, AMF, apr, chiA, nxrA, nifH, AOA, AOB, nirS, nirK, nosZ). Three individual plants were excavated per plot for nucleic acid extraction. Soil firmly adhered to the roots was sampled as rhizosphere soil. Bulk soil samples (0 - 10 cm) were taken from the plants at a 10 cm horizontal distance. In total, 240 samples were collected (2 fields, 5 fertilization treatments, 2 soil compartments, 4 plot replicates with 3 plants each) and sieved to 2 mm. Our data show that the fertilization treatment had less impact on bacteria involved in P turnover but significantly affected the abundance of bacteria catalyzing key steps of the N cycle. This was particularly pronounced for SB, where higher P solubility increased the abundance of bacteria associated with N mineralization. Research domain: Soil Sciences Research question: None

Abstract_text_2: 
 Acceptability of novel bone char fertilizers depends on their P release but reactions at bone char surfaces and impacts to soil P speciation are insufficiently known. By sequential fractionation and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy we investigated whether and how the chemical composition of bone char particles has been altered in soil and, consequently, has affected the P speciation of amended soils. Therefore, two different kinds of bone char particles (BC, produced by pyrolysis of degreased animal bone chips at 800 ºC and BCplus, a BC enriched with reduced sulfur compounds) were manually separated from the soil at the end of two different experiments: “incubation-leaching” and “ryegrass cultivation”. Sequential P-fractionation of amended soils showed P-enrichment in all fractions as compared to the control. The most P increase between all treatments significantly occurred in the NaOH-P and resin-P fractions in response to BCplus application in both, incubation-leaching and ryegrass cultivation experiments. This increase of the readily available P fraction in BCplus treated soils was confirmed by linear combination fitting (LCF) analysis on P K-edge XANES spectra of BCs particles and amended soils. The proportion of Ca-hydroxyapatite decreased, whereas the proportion of CaHPO4 increased in BCplus particles after amended soils had been incubated and leached and cropped by ryegrass. Based on P-XANES speciation as determined by LCF analysis, the proportion of inorganic Ca(H2PO4)2 increased in amended soils after BCplus application. These results indicated that soil amendment with BCplus particles leads to elevated P concentration and maintains more soluble P species than BC particles even after 230-days of ryegrass cultivation.

 50 years box plot experiment in Grossbeeren (1972 - 2022) - Plots.
Abstract_text_2: 
 The Box Plot Experiment in Grossbeeren was set up in 1972 to investigate the effect of different fertilization strategies within an irrigated vegetable crop rotation system for three different soils. Therefore, this vegetable long-term fertilization experiment can be used to investigate different plant-soil-systems under the same climatic conditions. The experimented was halted in 2022. The experimental site (52°21’01.30’’ E, 13°19’05.47’’ N, 50 m a.s.l.) is located in the transition zone between the more maritime-affected Northern German Plain and the continental climate of the European mainland. Weather data were collected in an agrometeorological station close to the experimental area. The long-term means (1991-2020) for air temperature and annual precipitation are 9.7 °C and 492 mm. The single plots are quadratic concrete boxes with walls of 10 cm thickness, a surface area of 4 m2 and a depth of 75 cm. The upper 50 cm are filled with the tested soils; the lower 25 cm comprises a coarse-sandy drainage layer. The three soil types are Arenic Luvisol (weak loamy sand), Gleyic Fluvisol (heavy sandy loam) and Luvic-Phaeozem (medium clayey silt) according to the World Reference Base – WRB (and the Bodenkundliche Kartieranleitung – KA4). Within 10 rotations, the vegetable species white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata f. alba), carrot (Daucus carota L.), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), leek (Allium porrum L.) and celery (Apium graveolens L. var. rapaceum Mill.) were cultivated. No celery was cultivated during the first rotation. The experiment consists of 12 fertilization treatments in different combinations of mineral N fertilization and organic amendments and as quadruplicate for each of the three soils. The experimental set-up scheme can be found in the supplementary material. Mineral N fertilizer was applied as calcium ammonium nitrate. Mineral P and K fertilization was uniform for all treatments. Total N and total C in soil, plant and organic amendments were determined using a CNS analyser VARIO El (Elemental Hanau) since 1995 and before by wet combustion with K2Cr2O7 und H2SO4. C and N in the soil samples and N in the plant samples were analysed annually. The C contents of the crop residues (leaf + stalk + root) of the five vegetable species were investigated irregularly. In autumn, the soil was annually dug up to 20 cm by using a spade. Weeds were removed by a combination of mechanical (cultivator, rake or hoe) and chemical measures. Insect protection nets, insecticides or fungicides were used where necessary. Approximately 150 mm per year was additionally irrigated with a sprinkler system. More details about the experiment’s description can be found in the supplementary material. Description of table 1 Related datasets are listed in the metadata element 'Related Identifier'.

 Assessment of analytical method changes of soil organic carbon in the long-term experiment V140, ZALF, Germany.
Abstract_text_2: 
 This data set belongs to the long-term experiment V140 (https://doi.org/10.20387/bonares-8fhj-r52g) and includes a series of soil organic carbon data from historical and reanalyzed soil samples from ZALFs institutional soil archive. This kind of data serve to study the impact of analytical method changes in the laboratory over decades on soil organic carbon concentrations. As treatment changes have occurred due to technological advancements, so have analytical soil methods. This may lead to method bias over time and could affect the data basis of LTE for robust interpretation and conclusions if not properly considered. This particular data set aimed to quantify differences in SOC due to several changes (combustion temperature and analytical instruments) conducted for dry combustion method from 1976 to 2008, using the same soil samples from selected treatments of the LTE V140 of ZALF in Germany.

Polychlorierte Biphenyle (PCB) in Fischen aus der Nord- und Ostsee (2021)

Abstract:
Polychlorierte Biphenyle (PCB) sind industriell hergestellte persistente chlorierte organische Substanzen, die z.B. in Kondensatoren, Transformatoren oder in Hydrauliköl eingesetzt wurden. Ihr Einsatz ist seit 2001 weltweit verboten. Einige PCB sind krebserregend und habe aufgrund ihrer ähnlichen Struktur eine vergleichbare Wirkung wie Dioxin. Die höchsten PCB-Belastungen findet man in Organismen am Ende der Nahrungskette wie Raubfischen oder marinen Säugern. Gemessen werden die sechs Indikator-PCBs 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180 und das dioxinähnliche PCB-Kongener 118. Die Gehalte werden im Rahmen des Umwelt-Monitorings des Thünen-Instituts für Fischereiökologie regelmäßig überwacht, um die Höhe der Belastung zu erfassen und zu bewerten sowie regionale und zeitliche Unterschiede in dieser Belastung festzustellen. Die Ergebnisse fließen in nationale und europäische Umweltbewertungen ein.

 Regional climate change observational data FOR 1695 (Part 3.6 of data collection, table SOIL_SITE6).
Abstract_text_2: 
 We present a comprehensive, high-quality dataset characterising soil-vegetation and land-surface processes from continuous measurements conducted in two climatically contrasting study regions in South West Germany: the warmer and drier Kraichgau region with a mean temperature of 9.7°C and annual precipitation of 890 mm, and the cooler and wetter Swabian. Alp with mean temperature 7.5°C and annual precipitation 1042 mm. In each region, measurements were conducted over a time period of nine cropping seasons from 2009 to 2018. The backbone of the investigation was formed by six eddy-covariance stations (EC) which measured fluxes of water, energy and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere at half hourly resolution. This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes. Moreover, more than 1,200 soil samples were taken to study changes of carbon and nitrogen contents. One station in each region has now been set up as continuous observatories of state variables and fluxes in intensively managed agricultural fields.

Abstract_text_2: 
 Parent table of “Long-term fertilization field experiment Darmstadt (Feld A) from 1981 to 2009”. This data collection consists of 25 individual tables which are related to each other. General description: In 1980 a fertilization trial started at the Institute for Biodynamic Research in Darmstadt (today Forschungsring e.V.), Germany. The experiment was set up as a strip design with four replicates, the treatments being farmyard manure treatments with and without biodynamic preparations and mineral fertilization, each at various levels. The objective of the project was to study the product quality of vegetables. After this four year project, interesting differences began to emerge with respect to the soil parameters of organic and mineral treatments. Thus the trial was continued. After some years of a transitional period without particular investigations, a detailed soil biological project was carried out in 1989-1991, focusing on the effects of fertilization upon C- and N-dynamics, enzyme activities and microbial biomass in the soil. A third experimental period (from 1992 to 2009) has focused on the yield formation of cultivated crops and the long-term effects of fertilization treatments upon soil and crop development. Further details are given by Raupp and Oltmanns (2006) and Heitkamp et al. (2009).

 Meta-analysis: Drivers of soil health across EU - Soil Health Objectives.
Abstract_text_2: 
 This meta-analysis is conducted as part of SOLO (Soils for Europe), an EU´s Horizon Europe funded project and the results of the outcomes from this analysis is planned to feed into the other work packages to support the development of the co-creation and knowledge developing platforms for each of the eight EU soil mission objectives (soil erosion, land degradation, soil structure, soil sealing, soil organic carbon, soil literacy, soil pollution, and EU global footprint on soil) and with the addition of soil biodiversity. The driving force analysis in the SOLO project (Work Package 3) is built upon a comprehensive analytical framework which recognizes driving forces, pressures, state, impact, and response measures (DPSIR) as fundamental components of soil health. A scoping literature review is conducted to identify the drivers which will further feed into the analysis of the links between pressures (changes in soil and land management), and states (soil health objectives) and the respective impacts (ecosystem services). The literature review is divided in four parts based on different land use (urban and industrial, agriculture, forest, and nature) and is conducted in accordance with the PRISMA protocol. More than 40000 references have been scanned to filter out 451 relevant studies and to compile a list of drivers for soil and land use changes in the EU. The identified drivers across all land uses have been adjusted and standardised in in-person and online workshops. The set list of drivers is being used to filter the metadata and the presently filtered set of data is sorted according to the EU soil mission’s soil health objectives, land use, and location. The filtered data is compiled in excel to be uploaded in the repository to further support future use in research and publications. Research domain: Other Research question: None

Abstract_text_1: 
 P desorption kinetics from Fe- and Al-hydroxides   .
Abstract_text_2: 
 The synthetic commercially hydroxides were goethite (99%, Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, Massachusetts, USA), and gibbsite (Merck Millipore, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), which were of analytical grade. 2-line-ferrihydrite was prepared, at which a 1 M KOH was added to 500 ml of a 0.2 M Fe(NO3)3 ∙ 9 H2O-solution, until a pH of 7.5 was reached. The developed precipitate was centrifuged and washed for 5 min at 12134 x G, subsequently frozen, freeze-dried, and stored in a desiccator. The mixed Fe-Al-hydroxides were prepared by mixing 0.1 M Fe(NO3)3 ∙ 9 H2O and 0,1 M Al(NO3)3 ∙ 9 H2O were mixed in molar ratios of 1:0, 10:1, 5:1. 1:1, 1:5, 1:10 and 0:1, and brought to a pH of 6 with 5 M KOH. After equilibration for 1 h, the precipitate was centrifuged for 5 min at 12134 x G, washed with ultrapure water, dried at 60°C, and ground into a powder. The elemental composition of the adsorbents was verified using SEM-EDX, scanning electron microscopy (DSM 962, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (X-Max 50 mm² with INCA, Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, Great Britain). The final resulting mineral phase of pure Al(OH)3 and FeO(OH) for the amorphous hydroxides was identified. Determination of the minerals crystallization as well as amorphous structures were verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), using an Empyrean powder diffractometer (PANalytical, Almelo, Netherlands), with a theta-theta-goniometer, Cu-Kα radiation (λ=0.15418 nm), automatic divergent and anti-scatter slits and a PIXcel3D detector. Diffraction data were recorded from 4.6° to 84.9° 2ϴ with a step-size of 0.0131, a step time of 58.4 s, and generator settings of 40 kV and 40 mA. Prior to desorption, the hydroxides were coated on silica sand (particle size 0.2 – 0.8 mm, Merck Millipore) to ensure a similar sample treatment (e.g. centrifugation times and revolutions). The silica sand used was finely granulated, washed, and calcined. 10 g of the hydroxide in a 0.01 M NaNO3-solution were adjusted to pH 6, resulting in a final volume of 100 ml. 100 g of pure silica sand was added to the suspension, and shaken for 24 h at room temperature. The supernatant was decanted and the material was washed three to five times with the 0.01 M NaNO3-solution at pH 6, and in a final step with ultrapure water to remove hydroxide traces and soluble salts. The coated silica sand was oven dried at 60°C for 48 h. The silica-hydroxide mixtures were preload with P. Therefore, 200 ml of a 2 mmol l-1 KH2PO4 solution and a 0.01 M CaCl2 background solution were added to the mixtures. After shaking horizontally for 24 h at 150 motions min-1, the hydroxides were centrifuged for 5 min at 929 x G. The supernatant was filtrated and the adsorbed P concentration determined Desorption experiments were conducted with CaCl2, CaSO4, humic acid, and citric acid, adjusted to pH 6. 2.5 g of the coated silica sand was treated with 50 ml of 0.01 M CaCl2 or 0.01 M CaSO4. 5 g of the coated silica sand was used for desorption with 50 ml of 2 g l-1 humic acid and citric acid (Alfa Aesar). A concentration of 2 g l-1 for both humic and citric acid was selected to provide a concentration similar to that of the CaCl2 and CaSO4. For desorption experiments, treatment solutions were added to the samples, shaken at 150 motions min-1, and centrifuged for 15 min at 2091 x g. After this, the supernatant was filtered for measurement of P. The time steps were 2, 6, 24, 48, 168, 336, 672, and 1344 h. Research domain: Research question: 207-03 Plant Nutrition Which P bindings are formed on the various mineral Fe- and Al-hydroxide surfaces and how do inorganic and organic compounds contribute to the availability of both adsorbed/precipitated and naturally bound phosphorus from phosphate minerals?

 <p>The data set documents a Germany-wide and spatio-temporally consistent 1 × 1 km² analysis-ready time series (ARD-TS) of interpolated DOYs (days of the year) covering 56 beginning phenological development stages (phases) of 9 main crop types for the period between 1993 and 2021. The derivation is based on Germany-wide observations of the German Weather Service (DWD), which were statistically filtered and interpolated. </p> <p>The German Weather Service operates a phenological observation network. About 1200 observers monitor 160 phenological phases of wild and cultivated plants. The PHASE model was developed to interpolate the phenological observations for the entire territory of Germany (Gerstmann et al. (2016) Rel.Identifer TAB 8). The model combines the concept of growing degree days (GDD) with a geostatistical interpolation procedure. The PHASE model was applied to create a Germany-wide and spatio-temporally consistent 1 × 1 km² analysis-ready time series (ARD-TS) of interpolated DOYs (days of the year) covering 56 beginning phenological development stages (phases) of 9 main crop types for the period between 1993 and 2021. The dataset includes the following information: </p> <p> • Germany-wide interpolated temperature data from the German Weather Service (DWD), <br/> • raster datasets of interpolated crop-specific and Germany-wide incipient phenological development stages for the period between 1993 and 2020. The value in each pixel of these rasters represents the Day Of the Year (DOY) of the respective beginning phenological plant development stage, <br/> • accuracy metrics (RMSE, MSE, MAE, and R²) for each Germany-wide interpolation result. </p> <p>The code of the phase model is documented in a software repository (Rel.Identifer TAB 9 and 10). The temporally static model input data are also stored there. </p> <p><b>Research question </b> <br/> The dataset allows the spatio-temporal definition of phenological windows for any available year and user-defined region (Möller et al. (2020) Rel.Identifer TAB 1). Such information is important for various agricultural issues such as the derivation of weather or biodiversity indices, crop classification, soil erosion or crop yield modeling (Bucheli et al. (2022) Rel.Identifer TAB 5; Gerstmann et al. (2018) ; Rel.Identifer TAB 3; Möller et al. (2017, 2018) ; Rel.Identifer TAB 2 and 4; Riedsel et al.

PAH-Metaboliten in Fischen aus der Nord- und Ostsee (2020)

Abstract:
Polyaromatische Kohlenwasserstoffe (PAH) sind Bestandteil fossiler Energieträger und haben natürliche und anthropogene Quellen. Man findet sie in der Umwelt zum Beispiel in der Nähe von Häfen oder Schifffahrtsrouten. Zur Gruppe der PAH gehören auch krebserregende Substanzen. Fische metabolisieren PAH sehr schnell, so dass PAH selbst in Fischen kaum nachweisbar sind, wohl aber ihre Metaboliten in der Galle des Fisches. Die Gehalte von PAK-Metaboliten in Meeresfisch werden im Rahmen des Umwelt-Monitorings des Thünen-Instituts für Fischereiökologie regelmäßig überwacht, um die Höhe der PAK-Belastung indirekt zu erfassen und zu bewerten sowie regionale und zeitliche Unterschiede in dieser Belastung festzustellen.

Microsatellite/SSR dataset: pomological and molecular characterization of pear cultivars (Pyrus communis) of the German Fruit Genebank

Abstract:
The German Fruit Genebank (https://www.deutsche-genbank-obst.de/) is a decentralized network dedicated to coordinating various germplasm collections across Germany. The aim is to conserve and utilize the genetic resources of native fruit species, i.e. pear. For effective conservation, the investigation of authenticity of the genetic resources is essential. Between 2019 and 2023, two projects were performed on the pear collections of the German Fruit Genebank to characterize the cultivars pomologically and molecularly. Eight partners of the pear network of the German Fruit Genebank participated in the projects. First, at least two experts of the Fruit Orchard Agency Schlaraffenburg (Schlaraffenburger gGmbH, https://schlaraffenburger.de/) identify the pear cultivars pomologically and define the authentic cultivar name per tree and accession. Second, 17 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and seven reference genotypes in recommendation of the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources (ECPGR; http://www.ecpgr.cgiar.org/) Malus/Pyrus working group were used for genetic fingerprinting. The molecular analysis, including experimental work and statistical analysis for grouping the genetic profiles based on similarity, was performed by Microsynth ecogenics GmbH (Balgach, Switzerland). The pomological and molecular data was compiled and resulted in 1,838 complete samples. The most important data features per sample are the cultivar name, the authenticity expressed by the trueness-to-type criterion, the molecular group and the genetic profile. Lastly, the individual samples were collated into unique, synthetic genetic profiles per distinguished pear cultivars with the help of a computer program and manual review. Mutations and sports of cultivars cannot be distinguished molecularly, but only pomologically and are grouped within the origin cultivar as they carry the same molecular group but different cultivar names. In total, 420 pear cultivars with corresponding genetic fingerprints were identified and evaluated for their authenticity as part of the German Fruit Genebank as presented in the published dataset. Additionally, the genetic fingerprints were aligned to international datasets to assign the Pyrus UNiQue genotype code (PUNQ). To evaluate the certainty of the synthetic genetic profiles, a quality ratio was calculated per genetic locus and on average where the consensus across samples is reflected.

 Normalized FT-IR-spectra of pH-dependend phosphorus adsorption on goethite
Abstract_text_1: 
 Normalized FT-IR-spectra of pH-dependend phosphorus adsorption on goethite.
Abstract_text_2: 
 P adsorption was investigated on synthetic and commercially available goethite (99 %, Alfa Aesar). The composition and crystallinity was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analyses with an Empyrean powder diffractometer (PANalytical) with Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15418 nm). The determination of the d-values and the verification of the calculated lattice parameter were performed using the XPowder software. The specific surface area of 17.2 m2 g-1 was determined with an Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome) using a five-point BET measurement and N2. The point of zero charge (PZC) was determined using potentiometric titration, which was 8.8 for pure goethite without adsorbed P. P adsorption on goethite was studied in a batch setup at the pH values of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Therefore, goethite sample material (5 g) for the respective pH steps was adjusted to pH 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12, respectively, in ultrapure water with 0.01 M HCl (pH 4), or 0.1 M to 5 M KOH (pH 6 to 12) using a Potentiometric Compact Titrator G20S and combined DGi115-SC pH electrode (Mettler-Toledeo) under continuous stirring. For P adsorption, 0.5 g of goethite and 40 ml of a 0.15 mmol l-1 KH2PO4, solution, adjusted to pH 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 as well, were mixed to achieve a solid-solution ratio of 1:80. The goethite- KH2PO4 mixture was shaken horizontally at 150 motions min-1 for 24 h. The P concentration in the solution was determined after reaction times of 2, 24, 48, and 168 h. The samples have been centrifuged for 15 min at 3500 rpm and the clear supernatant was filtrated by using P-poor Whatmann 512 ½ filters. The concentrations of P and Fe were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Under real conditions in the soil, an influence of the P sorption on the pH is to be expected. Therefore, the pH change was taken into account both at the beginning and at the end of the adsorption experiments. The pH change was measured in a reference experiment that was treated exactly under the same conditions as P adsorption experiment. The amount of adsorbed P was referred to both the initial and the final pH. For FT-IR spectroscopic measurements, the solid goethite samples after an adsorption time of 2 and 168 h were dried for 24 h at 40°C, and stored in a desiccator. The samples were analyzed without further treatment prior to FT-IR measurements. IR spectroscopic analyses were carried out by measurement of the absorbance in the FT-IR Drift mode (Tensor 27 HTS-XT, Bruker) and a wavenumber range from 400 to 4000 cm-1. The spectrum of each treatment was created by generate the average of the 2 replicated samples by using the software Essential FTIR® (Operant LLC), where each sample included 40 scans. For evaluation, all spectra together were truncated in the range 1300 to 800 cm-1, baseline corrected, and normalized with respect to the highest absorbance. After 2 h adsorption time, the amount of adsorbed P was 0.52 µmol m-2 at pH 4, 0.65 µmol m-2 for pH 6, 0.58 µmol m-2 for pH 8, 0.29 µmol m-2 for pH 10, and 0.14 µmol m-2 for pH 12. Considering the initial pH, P adsorption on goethite after an adsorption time of 168 h was highest for pH 8, yielding a P surface coverage of 0.75 µmol m-2 after a reaction time of 168 h, followed by pH 6 with 0.72 µmol m-2, and pH 4 with 0.68 µmol m-2. The extent of adsorption decreased from pH 8 to 10 with 0.58 µmol m-2 and was lowest for pH 12 with 0.18 µmol m-2. The solution pH decreased for the initial pH 4 to 3.9., and for the initial pH of 6, the final pH was 5.0. For initial pH values 8.0 and 10.0, the corresponding final pH values were 6.7 and 7.6, respectively. At initial pH 12.0, the decrease of the solution pH weakened with a final pH of 11.6. Research domain: Soil Sciences Research question: How does the solution-pH affect the amount and binding motiv of adsorbed phosphorus on the goethite surface?

Abstract_text_2: 
 Parent table of long-term field experiment V140 Muencheberg. This data collection consists of 30 individual tables which are related to each other. General description of the Long-term Field Experiment ""V140"": The long-term field experiment ""V140"" was established in 1963 at the experimental site of the present Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF) about 50 km east of Berlin in the district Märkisch-Oderland. The area is characterized by dry periods, particularly during early summer. The long-term average annual precipitation rate and tempeature is 536 mm and 8.8°C, respectively. Weather data for the running period of V140 are available at the DWD (station number 03376 via https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/daily/kl/historical/). The V140 represents one of the few still active long-term field experiments on sandy soil. During the running period just smaller management measures changes have been done. Whereas originally questions to yield increase measures on sandy soil were in focus, present research put more focus on the effects of organic and mineral fertilization on essential aspects of the soil fertility. The V140 is around 0.5 ha and is located on a flat area. Before the establishment of V140 the site was cultivated uniformly. According to the German Guidelines Soil Assessment (Bodenschätzung) the dominating soil types are slightly loamy sand and sand (Sl4D and S4D). The most common soil sub type is Haplic Luvisol. The experiment includes 21 treatments: 5 levels of mineral fertilization combined with 4 levels of organic fertilization and one control. More information, e.g., database scheme, assorted literature overview, the detailed location plan, etc., can be found in the supplemental material.

 Effects of agricultural management on the quantity and quality of soil organic matter in 0-100 cm -  data from ten German long-term experiments.  - Thuenen Soil3 Soil Organic Matter stable isotopes 1.
Abstract_text_2: 
 Agricultural management can influence the quantity and quality of soil organic matter (SOM), thereby contributing to carbon (C) sequestration and climate change mitigation. The depth to which agricultural management practices affect SOM is uncertain. Soil depth can have an important influence on SOM dynamics, so it is important to consider depth effects to fully account for changes, particularly in soil organic C (SOC) stocks. This is particularly true when assessing C faming measures, which are becoming increasingly important due to climate change. We sampled and analysed the top metre of mineral arable soils from ten long-term experiments (LTEs) in Germany to quantify and qualify the depth-dependent effects on SOC stocks, C and nitrogen (N) content, the δ13C and δ15N signature and the C/N ratio of the soils due to common agricultural management practices: Mineral N fertilisation (only for SOC stocks), a combination of N, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilisation, irrigation, crop rotation with legumes, straw incorporation, farmyard manure (FYM) application, liming and reduced tillage. In addition, the effects of soil compaction (only for the SOC stocks) were analysed as a negative side-effect of agricultural management. The dataset includes metadata and research data on soil properties at 0-100 cm, e.g., mean annual temperature and precipitation, C and N content, SOC stocks, water content, texture data (sand, silt, clay), pH, δ13C and δ15N values. This table contains Data on Thuenen Soil3 Soil Organic Matter stable isotope 1. Related datasets are listed in the metadata element 'Related Identifier'. Dataset version 1.0

 International long-term experiment (LTE) 'Organic and Mineral Nitrogen Fertilization Experiment' (IOSDV) - Table 'PARZELLE'.
Abstract_text_2: 
 The long-term experiment (LTE) ""International Organic Nitrogen Fertilisation Trial"" (IOSDV) Rauischholzhausen (University Gießen) was set up in 1984 as part of an internationalseries of trials which were started simultaneously at about 15 locations in several European countries. The initiator of this series of trials was Eduard von Boguslawski, who also foundedthe international working group ""IOSDV"". The LTE ""IOSDV"" in Rauischholzhausen was later continued and managed by Bernd Honermeier (1996 - 2021). The original idea of this LTE was to compare three farming systems (farm types), (1) system without organic fertilisation (simulating a cash crop farm), (2) system with organic fertilisation from livestock (farmyard manure, simulating a farm with livestock) and (3) system with organic fertilisation from plant residues (straw, catch crops and digestate from a biogas plant). In these arable farming systems, the classic cash crops sugar beet (since 2010 silage maize), winter wheat and winter barley are grown in a crop rotation (one after the other in time) and at the same time also next to each other every year. Due to the central importance of nitrogen as a plant nutrient, mineral N fertilisation was included as a test factor and combined with all other test factors in four different dosages so that possible interactions could be investigated. Since the LTE was set up at several locations, the influence of site and climatic conditions on soil properties and plant yields as a function of organic and mineral N fertilisation can also be investigated. The trial was extended in 1997 by a variant with ""compost fertilisation"" (without and with certified compost), with the same crop rotation and mineral N fertilisation. Land Use Type: Field crops Research Theme: Fertilization LTE Category: Fertilization Farming Category: Conventional Research Parameter: -Plant: total biomass yield, grain yield, harvest index -Soil: Ct, Corg, Nt, nitrate N Factors: - Factor A: Crops (sugar beet/maize, winter wheat, winter barley) - Factor B: N-fertilization (5 levels) - Factor C: Organic fertilization (3 levels) Research question: The trial aims to clarify the long-term effects of different organic fertilisation (manure from livestock compared to organic matter from plants) on soil properties (Ct/Corg, Nt, Nmin) and on biomass yields of maize, winter wheat and winter barley. It should also be clarified whether there is an interaction between organic fertilisation and mineral N fertilisation as well as between fertilisation and site conditions regarding soil parameters and plant yields and whether these factors thus influence each other.

 <p>This product shows the distribution of rainfed and irrigated agricultural land across Kenya. This dataset has been produced using a large training dataset that contains a total area of 71,900 km² in training samples. The algorithm in the product used three years of Sentinel-2 data (2021-2023). Harmonics of NDVI were used to overcome the limitations of data gaps due to clouds and noise in the time series. The harmonics of the NDVI were then used along with averaged evapotranspiration (ET) and land surface temperature data from MODIS to feed a random forest classifier to produce the final product, along with several post-processing steps to smooth the dataset. The product can provide meaningful insights into areas in need of intervention due to climatic stress and areas within proximity to alternative water sources to assist in irrigation decision making.</p> <br/> NOTE: For technical reasons please click csv download and internally a zip File with the GeoTIFF will be set up and be available under your downloadlink.

 Normalized FT-IR spectra of crystalline and amorphous Fe- Al-hydroxides during P adsorption
Abstract_text_1: 
 Normalized FT-IR spectra of crystalline and amorphous Fe- Al-hydroxides during P adsorption.
Abstract_text_2: 
 Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic analyses were carried out during P adsorption on highly crystalline gibbsite, poorly crystalline 2-line-ferrihydrite and amorphous Fe:Al-hydroxide mixtures in the molar ratio 1:0, 10:1, 1:1, 1:10 and 0:1. The elemental composition of the adsorbents was verified by using SEM-EDX, scanning electron microscopy (DSM 962, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (X-Max 50 mm² with INCA, Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, Great Britain). The formation of pure Al(OH)3 and FeO(OH) for the amorphous hydroxides was revealed. Determination of the adsorbent crystallization as well as amorphous structures was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a PANalytical Empyrean powder diffractometer (Almelo, Netherlands) from GFZ Potsdam, with a theta-theta-goniometer, Cu-Kα radiation (λ=0.15418 nm), automatic divergent and anti-scatter slits and a PIXcel3D detector. Diffraction data were recorded from 4.6° to 84.9° 2ϴ with a step-size of 0.0131 and a step time of 58.4 s. The generator settings were 40 kV and 40 mA. Specific surface areas of all adsorbents were determined with an Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome, Odelzhausen, Germany) using a multi-point BET-measurement (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) and N2 as adsorptive medium. P adsorption was investigated with batch experiments, in which a solid-solution ratio of 1:20 was chosen for gibbsite, and a solid-solution ratio of 1:200 was chosen for ferrihydrite and the Fe:Al-hydroxide mixtures due to their high specific surface areas and P-adsorption capacity. The initial P-concentrations for the adsorption experiments were 150 µmol l-1, 1000 µmol l-1 and 2000 µmol l-1 KH2PO4 for gibbsite and 1000 µmol l-1, 2000 µmol l-1 and 5000 µmol l-1 KH2PO4 for ferrihydrite and the Fe:Al-hydroxides with a 0.01 mol l-1 CaCl2-background electrolyte solution, adjusted to a pH of 6. For P measurements, the gibbsite and ferrihydrite samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 336 × G, while the Fe:Al-hydroxide samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 21572 × G. The clear supernatant was filtered by using P-poor Whatman 512 1/1 filters. For FT-IR spectroscopic measurements, the remaining solid matter was dried for 24 h at 40°C, stored overnight in a desiccator and analyzed without further treatment. IR spectroscopic measurements were carried out by measurement of the absorbance in the FT-IR DRIFT mode (Tensor 27 HTS-XT, Bruker, Billerica, USA) with 40 scans per sample, a wavenumber range from 4000 to 400 cm-1, and a resolution of 1.9 cm-1. Research domain: Plant Nutrition Research question: Which P bindings are formed on the various mineral Fe- and Al-hydroxide surfaces and how do inorganic and organic compounds contribute to the availability of both adsorbed/precipitated and naturally bound phosphorus from phosphate minerals?

Abstract:
The Benguela upwelling system is one of the most productive marine ecosystems in the world; however, little is known about the community structure of mesopelagic fishes in its northern (nBUS) and southern (sBUS) subsystems. We analyzed around 1900 specimens from 13 stations in 2019, austral summer, in the nBUS and 11 stations in the sBUS during the austral summer and found 88 species and 24 families of mesopelagic fishes. Seven distinct assemblages characterized by water mass, oxygen concentration in the surface layer, and chlorophyll concentrations between 50 and 100 m were identified. In 2021 in austral winter, 15 stations were analyzed, of which 7 belonged to sBUS and 8 to nBUS.

The Influence of Politicians’ Sex on Political Budget Cycles: An Empirical Analysis of Spanish Municipalities

Abstract:
Does a politician’s sex influence political budget cycles (PBCs)? We answer this question using a sample of Spanish municipalities from the Madrid region for the period 2010−2019. The Madrid region has a homogenous set of budget rules that allows consistently categorising budget expenditure items as either ‘mandatory’ or ‘non-mandatory’ public services. After differentiating between smaller and larger municipalities, gender influence is studied along two dimensions: mayor’s sex and share of women in government. Our findings include, in regard to mandatory spending in smaller municipalities, that gender-balanced governments induce PBCs. In larger municipalities, when the share of women in government is above 60%, electoral spending is increased by up to 10% of an average municipal budget for mandatory spending, and up to 2.2% for non-mandatory. These findings are generally supported in a mixed-gender close election analysis.

Per- und Polyfluoralkylchemikalien (PFAS) in Fischen aus der Nord- und Ostsee (2020)

Abstract:
Per- und Polyfluoralkylchemikalien (PFAS) sind industriell hergestellte persistente fluorierte organische Substanzen, die z.B. zur Ausrüstung von Textilien und zur Oberflächenbehandlung verwendet werden. Sie sind weltweit verbreitet und wurden z.B. in Eisbären gefunden. Einige PFAS stehen im Verdacht krebserregend zu sein. Die höchsten PAFS-Belastungen in Fischen findet man im Süßwasser. Gehalte von PFAS in Meeresfisch sind oft in der Nähe der analytischen Nachweisgrenze. Die Gehalte werden im Rahmen des Umwelt-Monitorings des Thünen-Instituts für Fischereiökologie regelmäßig überwacht, um die Höhe der Belastung zu erfassen und zu bewerten sowie regionale und zeitliche Unterschiede in dieser Belastung festzustellen. Die Ergebnisse fließen in nationale und europäische Umweltbewertungen ein.

 Bacterial and archaeal abundance in top and subsoil samples in a field trail with mechanical strip-wise subsoil loosening and addition of biocompost  - Codes
Abstract_text_1: 
 Bacterial and archaeal abundance in top and subsoil samples in a field trail with mechanical strip-wise subsoil loosening and addition of biocompost  - Codes.
Abstract_text_2: 
 In German agricultural system, more than 50% of nutrient and water stocks are in the subsoil, but in more than 71% of agricultural fields, supplies are not accessible for the plants based on root-restricting soil layers. To allow the crops an easier access to deep soil layers a mechanical strip-wise subsoil loosing with the addition of biocompost (DLB treatment) was established in frame of Soil3 project (for further details: Schmittmann et al. 2021). In this study, the influence of subsoil management on microbial community composition was investigated 2020 in a field trail in Klein-Altendorf (Bonn), using the three different winter wheat genotypes Milaneco, Capo and Trebelir. Thereby, exhibit the genotypes Milaneco and Capo a more deep-rooting and the genotype Trebelir a shallower rooting system. We postulate, that (i) the absolute abundance of bacteria and archaea will be increased in DLB treatment plots. And we expected that (ii) that DLB treatment will create a shift in microbial community composition, especially in the subsoil layers. Soil and roots samples were taken from 0-30, 30-60 and 60-100 cm in June 2020, at flowering time of winter wheat, in three biological replicates. The soil type was classified as Haplic Luvisol (Hypereutric, Siltic) and is characterized by a silty clay loam texture with clay accumulation in the subsoil (between 45 and 95 cm soil depth). The copy numbers of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and archaeal 16S rRNA gene was quantified by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Subsequently, 16S amplicon sequencing was performed for all bulk soil and root samples and raw sequencing data is available at the sequencing read archive (SRA) under the BioProject PRJNA1129315 (SAMN42150195, SAMN42152877). Our data indicate a slightly increase in bacteria in soil samples among all genotypes and soil depths, this trend is not so evident for abundance of archaea in soil samples. For root samples an increase in bacterial and archaeal abundance was only observed for the genotype Capo, especially for the depths 0-30 and 30-60 cm. Alpha diversity was increased in the deep-rooting genotypes in root samples. In soil samples only for the genotype Milaneco a strong increase in alpha diversity was observed, especially in the samples from 30-60 cm. Furthermore, beta diversity for soil and root samples was only influenced by the different sampling depths but not by the genotype or the treatment. In addition, the shared ASVs representing the core microbiome, in soil and root samples, contain more shared ASVs between the genotypes per each depth in DLB treatment in comparison to control plots.

 Nutrients of shoot material in plants, grown in soils from three long-term field experiments (Data collection).
Abstract_text_2: 
 We conducted a minirhizotron experiment with soil samples taken in 2016 from the field sites of three long-term experiments, belonging to the Humboldt- Universität zu Berlin (HUB; Thyrow) and the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FIBL; Therwil) and the LTE in Bernburg (Anhalt-University). The soil, which underwent different fertilization strategies (mineral vs. organic and biodynamic fertilization vs. reduced and full N-fertilization) and cultivation practices (plough vs. cultivator) was used to cultivate lettuce as model plant in minirhizotrons for 9 weeks under controlled growth chamber experiments at the IGZ-Großbeeren. The content of macro- and micronutrients in bulk soil (see extra dataset submission) and plant samples were analyzed according to the certified protocols of the Association of German Agricultural Analytic and Research Institutes, VDLUFA, Germany (VDLUFA, 2020). After determination of fresh shoot biomass, shoots and soil samples were oven-dried at 60_C for three days and dry biomass was recorded. Subsequently, shoots were stored in a desiccator for another two days and 200–500 mg of dry plant material and 4 g of soil were subjected to microwave digestion with 5 ml of HNO3 (65%) and 3 ml of H2O2 (30%) for 20–30 min. Potasium, Na, P, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn concentrations in shoot tissue and soils were determined via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES); total C and N were determined via elemental analysis (Elementary Vario El cube, Elementar, Langenselbold, Germany). Soil pH was determined in calcium chloride solution and salinity via electrical conductivity. Additional data: the concentration of each element indicated by x / plant calculated from the shoot dry matter in column F (shoot DM [g]) in the exel sheet Research domain: Plant Cultivation and Agricultural Technology Research question: The experiment was established to study the different effects of fertilization management and soil cultivation on the yet unknown interactions of rhizodeposits and rhizosphere chemistry with its associated rhizosphere soil microbiota (fungal, bacterial and archaeal communities) and their impact on plant health and stress resilience in lettuce.

 A catalog of meta-data about agricultural long-term field experiments in Europe (EJP SOIL 7.3) (Data collection, parent table).
Abstract_text_2: 
 Long-term field experiments (LTEs) are crucial sources of knowledge on agricultural soil management. They are vitally important in monitoring, understanding and proving the changes in soil properties and crop production occurring as a result of agricultural management practices and climate change. Long-term field experiments will also be essential in the future and cannot be replaced by new analytical techniques or models; on the contrary, they are an indispensable basis for the calibration and validation of these techniques. Because of longevity, it is fairly costly to maintain them. Therefore, efforts aiming at more extensive and cooperative use of LTEs and the corresponding data should be promoted. This database collected with EJP SOIL (task 7.3) contains metadata from more than 200 LTEs across Europe. Metadata collected include precise description of the treatments (combination of factors) investigated related to tillage, crops, amendments, grazing and pest/weed management as well as measurements collected and pedo-climatic information. See Supplemental Information for the whole dataset. An analysis of this dataset can be found at https://github.com/ejp7-3/lte-db'. Dataset version 1.0

 P release kinetics from vivianite, hydroxyapatite and bone char.
Abstract_text_2: 
 The bone char used for P release experiments was produced by Bonechar Carvão Ativado Do Brasil Ltda. (Maringá, Brazil) in 2015. It has been manufactured by pyrolysis of rendered (de-fatted) bovine bones at more than 800°C. A particle size analysis of the bone char was carried out, whereby 100 g of char was divided into three particle size fractions: 200 µm, 200 - 2000 µm, and 2000 µm. The P bearing minerals used were the commercially available Ca-phosphate hydroxyapatite (Ca5[OH(PO4)3]) (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) and the Fe-phosphate vivianite (Fe32+[PO4]2 · 8H2O). Vivianite was prepared where 250 ml of a 0.035 M H3PO4-solution were added to solid FeSO4. The resulting 0.05 M FeSO4-solution was adjusted to pH 6 with 5 M KOH. The precipitate formed was centrifuged for 5 min at 2090 × G and washed with ultrapure water. The prepared vivianite was dried at 40°C and ground into powder using mortar and pestle. P, Ca, and Fe were determined using ICP-AES after pressure digestion or aqua regia digestion. The composition of hydroxyapatite and vivianite was verified using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area was determined with an Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome, Odelzhausen, Germany) using a multi-point BET-measurement (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) and N2 as adsorptive medium. The specific surface area of hydroxyapatite was with 68.4 m² g-1 1.7 fold higher than for vivianite with 39.5 m² g-1. Bone char had the highest specific surface area with values in the range from 92.1 to 94.8 m² g-1, increasing with decreasing particle size. P release experiments were conducted in triplicate by using a batch setup with an initial pH of 6. For this, 2.5 g of the bone char and the phosphate minerals were weighed into PE bottles. Batch solubilization experiments were performed with CaCl2 (Merck Millipore) and citric acid with the formula C6H8O7 (99 %, Alfa Aesar), adjusted to pH 6 with KOH. These reaction solutions were used in concentrations 0.01 M, 0.05 M, and 0.1 M, respectively. 50 ml reaction solution was added to the bone char samples and 40 ml was added to hydroxyapatite and vivianite samples, respectively. The samples were shaken on a horizontal shaker for 24 h at 200 motions min-1, centrifuged for 15 min at 2090 × G, and the supernatant was filtrated by using P-poor Whatman 512 1/2 filters. Following, fresh reaction solution was added to the samples. Samples for P measurement were taken after 2, 6, 24, 48, and 168 h. The cumulative P release based on 168 h with CaCl2 is very low for all used materials. While the total P release for bone char was close to the detection limit, minor P concentrations were measured for vivianite and hydroxyapatite, which increased slightly with increasing CaCl2 concentration. The use of citric acid enabled significantly more P to be solved, whereby an increase of dissolved P with increasing citric acid concentration was measured as well. At low citric acid concentration of 0.01 M, the lowest amount of P was released from bone char, where most P was released from the smallest particle fraction. In total, most P was released from hydroxyapatite after 168 hours. Research domain: Plant Nutrition Research question: Which P bindings are formed on the various mineral Fe- and Al-hydroxide surfaces and how do inorganic and organic compounds contribute to the availability of both adsorbed/precipitated and naturally bound phosphorus from phosphate minerals?

Abstract_text_2: 
 <p>The ZALF Focus Area - Paulinenaue is located 30 km west of Berlin. ZALF manages 60 ha of grassland on a lowland fen research site founded in 1949 by Prof. E.A. Mitscherlich in the Havelländisches Luch.</p> <p>Own herds of different animal species e.g. Uckermärker cattle are available for grassland use.</p> <p>The ZALF research station Paulinenaue is located on the edge of the 56,000 ha NATURA2000 (SPA) site Rhin-Havelluch (<a href=""https://www.bfn.de/natura-2000-gebiet/rhin-havelluch"">see BfN NATURA2000 in Germany</a>; <a href=""https://lfu.brandenburg.de/lfu/de/aufgaben/natur/natura-2000/managementplanung/spa-rhin-havelluch/"">see LfU SPA site Rhin Havelluch</a>) This area represents the shallow- to medium-depth fens of northeastern Germany, which are predominantly used as grassland. ZALF's agricultural landscape research questions related to grassland and peatland are comprehensively addressed here. </p> <h1>Main research tasks that are addressed in this focus area:</h1> <p>1. Acting as a coordinating body for scientific work in the field of fenland research or grassland and fenland ecology. Implementation of a long-term data collection program on landscape-relevant variables on typical grassland sites of the ZALF study area.<br/> 2. Supervision of a grassland long-term experiment and a groundwater lysimeter installation with 103 lysimeters and 15 different soil types of Northeast Germany for parameter quantification and validation for grassland and landscape models.<br/> 3. Collaboration on ecosystem-based landscape analysis and related research projects in close cooperation with all program areas and working groups of ZALF. Securing grassland-specific experimental and mapping work in the landscape.<br/> 4. Organizing large-scale landscape ecology experiments involving agricultural and processing enterprises with a focus on production ecology research, development and redesign of the cultivated landscape. Active participation in the establishment of new landscape laboratories of ZALF and contribution of existing knowledge and experience.</p> <p>The fenlands of the Rhin-Havelluch have essentially developed as marshy and silted-up fenland with waterlogging by groundwater. The 300 years of drainage in connection with intensive use in the past decades has contributed to a considerable extent to the fen shrinkage and mineralization of the organic soil substance. Therefore, the subject of research is particularly the protection of the fenland body and extensive agricultural land use practices that conserve abiotic and biotic resources.</p> <p>The soil physical and chemical parameters of the study area can be characterized as follows:&#xD; Soil physical parameters from the crumb horizon of the Rhin-Havelluch.<br/> Organic matter content (%): 65 - 70<br/> Solids (Vol.%): 19 - 27<br/> Usable water capacity (Vol.%): 42 - 48<br/> Minimum air capacity (Vol.%): 11 - 12<br/> Ca (%): 2.4 - 4.8<br/> K (%): 0,07 - 0,10<br/> P (%): 0,07 - 0,11<br/> N (%): in organic matter 4.2 - 4.3<br/> pH value: 5.8 - 7.2</p> <p> The long-term mean of precipitation (1981 - 2010) is 536 mm.

Abstract:
The data contain habitat suitability (given in %) and biomass (given in tons) of commercial fish species in the North Sea and Baltic Sea. For the North Sea, habitat suitability is shown for the 1970s and as a change in response to climate change across decades from 1970 to 2050. For the Baltic Sea, habitat suitability is shown for the 1990s and as a change in response to climate change across decades from 1990 to 2050. Biomass distribution in 2050 was mapped according to habitat suitability as redistribution of three scenarios of total biomass (high, medium and low). Those scenarios were retrieved based ICES Stock assessment time-series. Data can be viewed using the web-map available at Thünen Atlas.

 Piché evaporation at agroforestry site in Forst, 2019 and 2020
Abstract_text_1: 
 Piché evaporation at agroforestry site in Forst, 2019 and 2020.
Abstract_text_2: 
 Piché evaporation was determined at the agroforestry site and the treeless reference site at several occasions during the vegetation periods 2019 and 2020 when the fields were cultivated with barley (Hordeum vulgare) and bristle oat (Avena strigosa), respectively. The Piché evaporimeters are glass tubes with a scale which are sealed on one site and closed with perforated filter paper on the other side. They were filled with water, mounted to wooden battens directly above the crop and left on-site for 24 hours. Within the 24 hours, water evaporates via the filter paper and the amount of evaporation can be determined by reading the scale on the evaporimeter. The table contains these readings after the 24 hr measurement period for each measuring point. Research domain: Other Research question: Does Piché evaporation differ at the agroforestry site vs. the treeless reference site? Within the agroforestry site, does Piché evaporation differ depending on the distance to the tree rows?

Recommendations for the introduction of a national animal welfare monitoring system in Germany : 6 steps for implementation

Abstract:
As part of the ‘National Animal Welfare Monitoring’ (NaTiMon) project, a consortium of 10 institutions developed a concept for the regular and systematic assessment of animal welfare in livestock farming for Germany. With the involvement of stakeholders, suitable indicators were selected, possibilities for the use of existing data were identified and procedures for the collection of missing data developed. Indicators for an assessment of animal welfare in husbandry, transport and slaughter of cattle, pigs, chickens, turkeys, sheep and goats from terrestrial livestock farming and of rainbow trout and common carp from aquaculture were included as well as indicators describing conditions of livestock farming. The following steps are recommended for the implementation of a future national animal welfare monitoring system: (1) Create a legal basis (2) Provide an institutional basis and infrastructure (3) Provide funds for implementation (4) Enable the use of existing data (5) Implement the collection of missing data (6) Publish an animal welfare monitoring report

Datensatz: Die Biomasse- und Fangergebnisse von Ecospace (EwE) Simulationen für die südliche Nordsee getestet mit verschiedenen Biomasseverteilungskarten (Zeitskala und Habitatdarstellung (Vorhandensein/Abwesenheit versus Abundanz)).

Abstract:
Räumlich-zeitlich aufgelöste Ökosystemdynamiken lassen sich mit Hilfe des Programms Ecopath with Ecosim, im speziellen der räumlichen Komponente Ecospace darstellen. Dieses Modul hat sich in den letzten Dekaden ständig weiterentwickelt und neue Möglichkeiten der Modellparametrisierungen sind dazu gekommen. Eine neue Methode ist der „spatio-temporal dataframework“, welcher eine Veränderung der räumlichen Komponenten über die Modellprojektionszeit ermöglicht, inklusive der Habitatpräferenzen basierend auf Biomassekarten verschiedener im Model eingebundener Gruppen. Allerdings fehlen vor allem zu der Implementierung von Biomassekarten als Habitatpräferenzen für einzelne Gruppen noch weitestgehend „best practice“ Empfehlungen. Getestet wurde daher die Frequenz der Veränderungen (statisch, halbjährig, jährlich, alle 5 Jahre) und die Art der Habitatpräferenz (ausgedrückt durch Anwesenheit/Abwesenheit oder durch Abundanz). Die hier präsentierten Datensätze sind Modellergebnisse (Biomasse und Fang) für das Ökosystemmodell der südlichen Nordsee für alle Frequenzen und Habitatpräferenzen.

 Wind Dispersal Ability of Phytopathogenic Fusarium and Alternaria in a Wind Tunnel Experiment.
Abstract_text_2: 
 Dispersal processes play an essential role in cereal diseases caused by phytopathogenic Fusarium and Alternaria. However, most empirical studies of Fusarium spore dispersal have focused on vertical transport by rain splash, while wind dispersal has been mostly neglected. Our objective was to determine the ability of Fusarium and Alternaria spores to disperse via wind under controlled conditions in a wind tunnel study. Thirteen Fusarium and three Alternaria species with diverse spore varieties were studied by placing them in the wind stream at wind velocities of 5 and 8 m s-1 and collecting them after 6 m and a period of 1 h using a newly developed air sampling box.

 Kinetics of P adsorption on crystalline and amorphous Fe- and Al-hydroxides
Abstract_text_1: 
 Kinetics of P adsorption on crystalline and amorphous Fe- and Al-hydroxides.
Abstract_text_2: 
 P adsorption was investigated using batch experiments on highly crystalline goethite and gibbsite, poorly crystalline 2-line-ferrihydrite and amorphous Fe:Al-hydroxide mixtures in the molar ratio 1:0, 10:1, 1:1, 1:10 and 0:1. A solid-solution ratio of 1:20 was chosen for gibbsite, and a solid-solution ratio of 1:200 was chosen for ferrihydrite and the Fe:Al-hydroxide mixtures due to their high specific surface areas and P-adsorption capacity. The initial P-concentrations for the adsorption experiments were 150 µmol l-1, 1000 µmol l-1 and 2000 µmol l-1 KH2PO4 for gibbsite and 1000 µmol l-1, 2000 µmol l-1 and 5000 µmol l-1 KH2PO4 for ferrihydrite and the Fe:Al-hydroxides with a 0.01 mol l-1 CaCl2-background electrolyte solution, adjusted to a pH of 6. For P measurements, the gibbsite and ferrihydrite samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 336 × G, while the Fe:Al-hydroxide samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 21572 × G. The clear supernatant was filtered by using P-poor Whatman 512 1/1 filters. The elemental composition of the adsorbents was verified by using SEM-EDX, scanning electron microscopy (DSM 962, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (X-Max 50 mm² with INCA, Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, Great Britain). The formation of pure Al(OH)3 and FeO(OH) for the amorphous hydroxides was revealed. Determination of the adsorbent crystallization as well as amorphous structures was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a PANalytical Empyrean powder diffractometer (Almelo, Netherlands) from GFZ Potsdam, with a theta-theta-goniometer, Cu-Kα radiation (λ=0.15418 nm), automatic divergent and anti-scatter slits and a PIXcel3D detector. Diffraction data were recorded from 4.6° to 84.9° 2ϴ with a step-size of 0.0131 and a step time of 58.4 s. The generator settings were 40 kV and 40 mA. Specific surface areas of all adsorbents were determined with an Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome, Odelzhausen, Germany) using a multi-point BET-measurement (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) and N2 as adsorptive medium. The P adsorption kinetics of goethite showed an adsorbed P amount of 100 % (0.2 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 150 µmol l-1, 100 % (1.2 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 1000 µmol l-1, and 100 % (2.4 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 2000 µmol l-1, respectively after an adsorption time of 2688 h (16 weeks). The P adsorption by gibbsite increased strongly with increasing initial P concentration and totaled 100 % (3.2 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 150 µmol l-1, 45 % (10.2 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 1000 µmol l-1, and 42 % (19.5 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 2000 µmol l-1, respectively after an adsorption time of 2688 h. The P adsorption kinetics of ferrihydrite showed an adsorbed P amount of 100 % (0.01 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 1000 µmol l-1, 100 % (0.07 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 2000 µmol l-1, and 99 % (0.14 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 5000 µmol l-1, respectively after an adsorption time of 2688 h. The P adsorption kinetics of 1 Fe:0 Al showed an adsorbed P amount of 100 % (17.6 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 1000 µmol l-1, 100 % (35.7 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 2000 µmol l-1, and 100 % (88.5 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 5000 µmol l-1, respectively after an adsorption time of 2688 h. The P adsorption kinetics of 10 Fe:1 Al showed an adsorbed P amount of 100 % (0.8 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 1000 µmol l-1, 100 % (1.6 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 2000 µmol l-1, and 100 % (4.1 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 5000 µmol l-1, respectively after an adsorption time of 2688 h. The P adsorption kinetics of 5 Fe:1 Al showed an adsorbed P amount of 100 % (0.9 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 1000 µmol l-1, 100 % (1.8 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 2000 µmol l-1, and 100 % (4.6 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 5000 µmol l-1, respectively after an adsorption time of 2688 h. The P adsorption kinetics of 1 Fe:1 Al showed an adsorbed P amount of 99 % (2.5 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 1000 µmol l-1, 100 % (5.0 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 2000 µmol l-1, and 100 % (12.6 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 5000 µmol l-1, respectively after an adsorption time of 2688 h. The P adsorption kinetics of 1 Fe:5 Al showed an adsorbed P amount of 89 % (203.8 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 1000 µmol l-1, 91 % (427.5 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 2000 µmol l-1, and 97 % (1140.8 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 5000 µmol l-1, respectively after an adsorption time of 2688 h. The P adsorption kinetics of 1 Fe:10 Al showed an adsorbed P amount of 83 % (202.5 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 1000 µmol l-1, 85 % (428.0 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 2000 µmol l-1, and 94 % (1169.1 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 5000 µmol l-1, respectively after an adsorption time of 2688 h. The P adsorption kinetics of 0 Fe:1 Al showed an adsorbed P amount of 65 % (106.2 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 1000 µmol l-1, 69 % (228.2 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 2000 µmol l-1, and 82 % (688.1 µmol m-2) for an initial P concentration of 5000 µmol l-1, respectively after an adsorption time of 2688 h.

 Root exudation of lettuce grown for six weeks in soils from two long-term field experiments, replicated in 2018 (Data collection).
Abstract_text_2: 
 We conducted again a minirhizotron experiment. The soil, which underwent different fertilization strategies (mineral vs. organic and biodynamic fertilization) was used to cultivate lettuce as model plant in minirhizotrons for 6 weeks under controlled growth chamber experiments at the University of Hohenheim. The experiment was established to study the different effects of fertilization management on the yet unknown interactions of rhizodeposits and rhizosphere chemistry with its associated rhizosphere soil microbiota (fungal, bacterial and archaeal communities) and their impact on plant health and stress resilience in lettuce. Samples of the rhizosphere soil solution were collected with moist sorption filters (5 mm Ø, filter paper: MN815, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) placed onto the surface of lateral roots growing along the root observation window. Micro-sampling was conducted six weeks after sowing during vegetative growth of the lettuce plants, to account for most active carbohydrate partitioning to the roots and high root exudation during this phase. For each minirhizotron, rhizosphere sampling was conducted with two 5 mm sorption filters (equivalent to 1 cm root length), applied in triplicate in subapical root zones (1–2 cm behind the root tip) and basal root zones (older, mature parts of the root system, 8–9 cm behind the root tip). As a control, sampling was performed in soil zones without visible root development (soil without root contact). Samples for each minirhizotron were pooled after an incubation time of 4 h and kept frozen at minus 20°C.

Abstract:
Datenmeldung nach dem EGovG. Der Datensatz kann auf Anfrage zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Eine Datennutzungsvereinbarung wird abgeschlossen. Nitrogen (N) loss as ammonia (NH3) from agricultural systems is one of the major sources of atmospheric pollutants and is responsible for more than 50% of global NH3 emissions. Ammonia volatilization from animal manures may be altered by amendment with chars derived from pyrolysis (pyrochars) or hydrothermal carbonization (hydrochars) by providing exchange sites for ammonium (NH4+) or changing the pH of manure. Pyrochar and hydrochar differ in chemical and structural composition, specific surface area, and pH and therefore may affect NH3 volatilization differently. In a laboratory incubation experiment, we investigated the effect of pyrochar (pH 9.0) and hydrochar (pH 3.8) from Miscanthus on NH3 emission after addition to poultry manure and cattle slurry. We analyzed manure treatments with and without char addition and acidification and determined the effect of char addition on immobilization of manure-derived NH4+. Ammonia emission from pure poultry manure amounted 84% of the applied NH4+-N, while 67% of the applied NH4+-N was lost as NH3 from cattle slurry. Addition of pyrochar or hydrochar had no or only marginal effects on NH3 emissions except for a reduction in NH3 emissions by 19% due to hydrochar application to CS (p < 0.05), which seems to be primarily related to the char pH. Sorption of NH4+ by admixture of chars to manure was generally small: between 0.1- and 0.5-mg NH4+-N g−1 chars were sorbed. This corresponds to between 0.1 and 3.5% of the NH4+ applied, which obviously was not strong enough to reduce emissions of NH3. Overall, our results do not provide evidence that addition of pyrochar or hydrochar to cattle slurry and poultry manure is an effective measure to reduce NH3 volatilization.

Estimates of Water Consumption of Growing Pigs under Practical Conditions Based on Climate and Performance Data

Abstract:
The water consumption of fattening pigs was recorded under practical conditions and compared with predicted water consumptions. The experiment was carried out in summer 2020 with 79 fattening pigs. Data loggers were used to record the climate data temperature and relative humidity. This data were used to calculate the temperature-humidity index (THI). It was found that there were sometimes considerable discrepancies between the measured and calculated water consumption. One possible reason for this discrepancy could be the age of the existing water requirement equations, as there has been a clear breeding development in the last decades and thus a strong increase in pig performance. Based on the deviations, six new water consumption equations were established, which consider the parameters body weight (BW), temperature, THI and feed consumption. Factually, THI and body weight should be included in the equation as predictor variables, and the evaluation also shows good results, so the use of this equation in practice should be considered. Overall, it became apparent that there is still a need for further research to make the water consumption equations more precise. This would require a larger data base.

Data: Increased resilience of peas towards root-rot pathogens predicted by nematode metabolic footprints

Abstract:
The three attached table sets contain data from two identical long-term organically managed field trials (Exp1, Exp2) that were started in 2010 and 2011, comparing plough (~25 cm) versus shallow non-inversion tillage (i.e. minimum tillage; 5-10 cm) combined with transferred fresh mulch to potatoes. In 2019, soil samples were taken from the top 15 cm and chemical as well as biological soil characteristics including morphological identification of free-living nematodes were determined. Soils were further evaluated in a greenhouse assay for their ability to suppress pea root rot caused by Didymella pinodella, Fusarium avenaceum, and F. redolens. Table 1 “Agronomic data from pot experiments” contains all plant performance data of peas (dry and fresh matter yield, seedling mortality after transplanting, disease indices of the root and basal shoot). Data are given for each plot separately (raw data). Table 2 “Nematode family abundance” shows the morphologically identified nematode families and their abundance (nematodes in 100 ml soil) per plot. Nematode families are further characterized according to their feeding types (bacterivore, fungivore, herbivore, omnivore-carnivore) Table 3 “Bioindicators from NINJA (Nematode Indicator Joint Analysis;)” shows nematode based-bioindicators that were used in the publication and that were obtained after uploading the Table 2 to the NINJA platform (https://shiny.wur.nl/ninja/). This program automatically computes individual bioindicators based on nematode ecophysiology parameters published on the NEMAPLEX website http://nemaplex.ucdavis.edu/. The indicators were calculated for each field plot separately.

Quantitative descripton of marine litter at the seafloor of the Baltic Sea

Abstract:
Marine litter at the seafloor comprises different materials. Plastic is the most frequent material of marine litter found at the seafloor of the Baltic Sea (55,6%). ""Abandoned, lost, discarded or otherwise lost fishing gear"" (ALDFG) is a subgroup of plastic litter with special importance for environmental assessment because it has a defined source and may pose a health risk to animals. With the data provided, marine litter at the seafloor of the Baltic Sea was quantified and characterized with special regard to fishery as source. 72 litter items (LI) were collected within fishery catches by bottom trawling during three cruises in 2020 and 2021. The data were used to quantify litter at the seafloor of the Baltic Sea (9.2 LI/km²) including 2.2 LI/km² ALDFG and 0.4 LI/km² fishery nets. We conclude that fishery is an important source of litter and ALDFG represent a considerable share of marine litter with 22.2%. Methode Categorisation of litter Total litter comprises the sum of any item of obvious anthropogenic origin. Litter items (LI) were assigned to one of the six major categories: plastic, metals, rubber, glass/ceramics, natural products or miscellaneous. Subsequently, each item was classified into one of the 45 sub-categories. The eight sub-categories of metals were: cans (food), cans (beverage), fishing related, drums, appliances, car parts, cables and other. Rubber comprised the following six sub-categories: boots, balloons, bobbins (fishing), tyre, glove and other. The four sub-categories of glass/ceramics were the following: jar, bottle, piece and other. Natural products were sub-categorized into: wood (processed), rope, paper/cardboard, pallets and other. Miscellaneous comprise with clothing/rags, shoes and other three sub-categories. Stones or other non-anthropogenic items collected by the trawl are not defined as litter and were therefore omitted in this study. ALDFG litter as a sub group of total litter, was defined as sum of the following seven ICES sub-categories: A5 (fishery line monofilament), A6 (fishery line entangled), A7 (synthetic rope), A8 (fishery nets), A16 (other fishing related plastic), B3 (bobbins from fishery) and C3 (metal from fishery). Items from these sub-categories have a close link to the fishing gear itself. Fishery nets as a sub-group of ALDFG litter is represented by ICES sub-category A8 (fishery nets).

Abstract:
Oft wird angenommen, dass ländliche Räume über Wohnraum verfügen, um Geflüchtete dezentral unterzubringen. In Abhängigkeit vom konkreten Wohnort kann es aber sein, dass dort wichtige Infrastrukturen nur schwer erreicht werden können, was negative Auswirkungen auf die Teilhabechancen der Betroffenen haben kann. Daher haben wir für die Projektregionen die Erreichbarkeit ausgewählter Infrastrukturen mittels verschiedener Verkehrsträger mit dem Thünen-Erreichbarkeitsmodell analysiert. Die Abbildung zeigt exemplarisch, wie sich innerhalb der Untersuchungsregionen die Erreichbarkeit der nächsten Haltestelle des öffentlichen Personenverkehrs darstellt. Je blauer, umso kürzer die Reisezeit, je oranger, umso länger. Es zeigen sich deutliche Erreichbarkeitsunterschiede in Abhängigkeit vom nutzbaren Verkehrsträger sowie innerhalb der Regionen in Abhängigkeit vom konkreten Wohnort.

Weinblattmetabolite als Resistenzmarker für eine Plasmopara viticola Widerstandsfähigkeit

Abstract:
Der Falsche Mehltau der Weinrebe ist eine der bedeutendsten Erkrankungen der europäischen Weinrebe Vitis vinifera LINNÉ subsp. vinifera. Er wird durch den obligat biotrophen Oomyceten Plasmopara viticola (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) Berl. & De Toni, (1888) hervorgerufen, welcher Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts ungewollt nach Europa eingeführt wurde. Amerikanische Weinreben sind weitestgehend resistent gegen den Falschen Mehltau und könnten auf die eine oder andere Art zum Schutz der anfälligen Reben auch gegen P. viticola beitragen. Daher beschäftigt sich diese Arbeit mit dem „Metabolite profiling“ von Resistenzmarkern (RM) aus dem Spektrum der flüchtigen Sekundärmetabolite von anfälligen und resistenten Reben. Es wurden in Freiland- und Gewächshausversuchen zehn Genotypen mit unterschiedlicher Resistenz gegen P. viticola analysiert. Darunter befanden sich drei verschiedene Vitis Arten (V. vinifera, V. riparia, V. labrusca) und einige Hybridreben. In einem zweijährigen Versuch wurden die konstitutiven Marker von jeweils drei Entwicklungsstadien (BBCH6, BBCH8 und BBCH9) ermittelt. Außerdem wurden induzierte Marker analysiert. Des Weiteren wurde der Zusammenhang zwischen der Blattposition und dem Auftreten von RM untersucht. Hierbei wurden mit den verwendeten Metabolomics-Methoden auch Marker für die Blattposition identifiziert. Für das „Metabolite profiling“ wurden die Weinblätter mittels HS-SPME-GC-EI-MS analysiert und anschließend mit non-targeted und targeted Analysenmethoden ausgewertet. Der Vergleich der Metabolitprofile zeigte, dass das Entwicklungsstadium den stärksten Einfluss auf das Metabolitprofil hat und der Einfluss der Blattposition so gering ist, dass er vernachlässigt werden kann. Es konnten 41 konstitutive RM ermittelt werden. Die identifizierten Metabolite stammten aus den Stoffklassen der green leaf volatiles (GLV), Norisoprenoide, Benzoat-Derivate, Monoterpenoide, einem Furan und einem Sesquiterpen. Hierbei zeigte sich, dass GLV, Norisoprenoide, Benzoat-Derivate und 2-Ethylfuran fast ausschließlich in den resistenten Genotypen in höherer Konzentration vorlagen als in den Anfälligen. Monoterpenoide und das Sesquiterpen α-Calacoren lagen hauptsächlich in anfälligen Genotypen von V. vinifera in höherer Konzentration vor als in resistenten Genotypen. Weiterhin konnte gezeigt werden, dass Monoterpenoide verstärkt im Entwicklungsstadium BBCH6 in signifikant höheren Konzentrationen in V. vinifera ermittelt wurden. Wohingegen das Sesquiterpen α-Calacoren niemals im BBCH6, sondern erst in den späteren Entwicklungsstadien in signifikant erhöhter Konzentration in V. vinifera ermittelt wurde. GLVs traten als RM in den resistenten Genotypen wie V. labrusca auf und dann erst in späteren Entwicklungsstadien, hauptsächlich im Entwicklungsstadium BBCH9. Für die konstitutiven RM aus den Gruppen der Norisoprenoide, Benzoat-Derivate und Furan wurde keine Abhängigkeit des Entwicklungsstadiums beobachtet. Allerdings wurden drei weitere Metabolite als RM ermittelt, die eine starke Korrelation zum Entwicklungsstadium aufwiesen. Sie traten zunächst in BBCH6 in signifikant höheren Konzentrationen in V. vinifera und in BBCH9 in signifikant höheren Konzentrationen in V. labrusca auf. Diese RM mit wechselnder Korrelation waren die beiden Monoterpenoide Geranylaceton und α-Terpineol, sowie das GLV (Z)-3-Hexenal. Nach bestem Wissen und Gewissen ist der Zusammenhang zwischen Auftreten der konstitutiven RM und Entwicklungsstadium bisher noch nicht beschrieben worden. Es ist eine neue Erkenntnis dieser Arbeit, dass Monoterpenoide als RM in Reben hauptsächlich in BBCH6 auftreten und GLV sowie Sesquiterpene hauptsächlich in BBCH9 als RM ermittelt wurden; wohingegen Norisoprenoide, Benzoat-Derivate und Furan zu allen getesteten Entwicklungsstadien als RM auftraten. Des Weiteren traten Monoterpenoide und das Sesquiterpen α-Calacoren artspezifisch häufiger in V. vinifera als konstitutive RM auf, wohingegen das Furan 2-Ethylfuran niemals in V. vinifera als RM in Erscheinung trat. Benzoat-Derivate und GLVs wurden am häufigsten in V. labrusca stämmigen Genotypen als RM detektiert. Norisoprenoide traten am häufigsten, aber nicht ausschließlich in V. riparia als RM in Erscheinung. Nach besten Wissen und Gewissen ist der Zusammenhang zwischen dem Auftreten von Norisoprenoiden als RM und der Artspezifität zu V. riparia eine neue Erkenntnis dieser Arbeit. Dennoch soll hier kurz erwähnt werden, dass diese Artspezifität sich ausschließlich auf die Eingruppierung als konstitutive RM bezieht. Monoterpene sind auch Bestandteil des Metabolitprofils von V. labrusca und Norisoprenoide sind wichtige Geschmacksträger in Qualitätsweinen. Es konnten 24 induzierte RM ermittelt werden. Dabei stellte sich entgegen der ursprünglichen Erwartung heraus, dass die meisten induzierten RM (19 von 24) in der pilzwiderstandsfähigen Züchtung Regent auftraten und nur sechs in der resistenten V. labrusca-stämmigen Hybride Blaue Isabella und in V. riparia. Für alle ermittelten RM wurde nach Publikationen zur Bioaktivität recherchiert. Für die RM 2- Ethylfuran, einem Isomeren-Mix aus (Z)- und (E)-Ocimen sowie β-Cyclocitral wurde bereits eine inhibierende Wirkung auf P. viticola publiziert. Dagegen wurden 20 Verbindungen hier zum ersten Mal mit einer Resistenzantwort auf eine P. viticola Infektion in Verbindung gebracht. Dabei handelt es sich um die sieben Norisoprenoide Theaspiran, (E)-β-Damascon, (E)- β-Damascenon, Dihydroedulan I, Megastigmatrienon, Sulcaton und Carvomenthenal A, die 2 GLVs Nonanol und (Z)-3-Hexenylacetat, sowie die zehn Terpenoide p-Cymen, p-Cymol, DLimonen, Alloocimen, β-Myrcen, β-Citronellol, Hotrienol, (Z)-Rosenoxid, Geraniumoxid und α- Calacoren.

Self-incompatibility (S) genotypes of cultivated sweet cherries – An overview update 2020

Abstract:
The fertility in sweet cherry is determined by a gametophytic self-incompatibility system, controlled by a multi-allelic S locus who prevents self-pollination. The fertilization is controlled by the interaction of an S allele specific ribonuclease (S-RNase) in the style with a pollen S specific F-box protein gene (SFB). Knowledge about the S genotype of sweet cherries is very important for cherry growers and breeders. In the last years molecular markers have been developed to distinguish the S alleles in sweet cherries. In the new update from October 2020 a total of 63 incompatibility groups in 1483 sweet cherries have been defined. 26 sweet cherries have a unique combination of S alleles and were described as universal donors and placed in the incompatibility group 0. Additionally, there exist 91 self-compatible sweet cherries, called group SC. A total of 22 different S alleles are described in the cultivated sweet cherries up to date. These are the S alleles S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S9, S10, S12, S13, S14, S16, S17, S18, S19, S21, S22, S24, S27, S30, S37. The goal of this work is to summaries all known data of the S alleles in cultivated sweet cherries. In Table 1 the S genotypes of all studied sweet cherries are described. Furthermore it includes information about the parentage if they are known. Table 2 gives an overview about all the detected incompatibility groups. The groups are sorted according to the group numbers and the S allele numbers, respectively. In Table 3 all genotypes of the incompatibility group 0 with a unique S genotype are listed. Table 4 includes all known self-compatible sweet cherries. All references to the information of the S genotypes are listed in a file named &#39;References&#39;. The present update needs to be further improved with all new S alleles data of sweet cherries. In addition, all new information about the parentage is very important for the breeding research. Please send all new or corrected data to the S alleles and the parentage of sweet cherries to mirko.schuster@julius-kuehn.de. An update of the S allele overview will take place in the next years.

LaForeT Livelihoods: Livelihood data based on a transnational household survey of the LaForeT project.

Abstract:
Results of the large scale household survey of approximately 3400 households in Ecuador, Zambia and the Philippines as conducted within the frame of the LaForeT project. An identical, structured questionnaire was applied for household interviews covering socio-demographics, land use, forest use, income activities, and contextual factors as well as other aspects of rural livelihoods. The surveys were conducted in 2017/18 in the Pilippines, in 2017 in Ecuador and in 2018/19 in Zambia.

Data set: The structure of the tetraploid sour cherry 'Schattenmorelle' (Prunus cerasus L.) genome reveals insights into its segmental allopolyploid nature

Abstract:
Sour cherry (Prunus cerasus) is an important fruit crop that is widely cultivated within the northern hemisphere. Its fruits are rich in nutrients and bioactive compounds that have been linked to numerous health benefits, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties. The demand for sour cherry has been increasing due to its use in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Breeding of sour cherry has been a major focus of research and development in recent years, aiming to improve yield, fruit quality, and disease resistance. One of the main challenges in sour cherry breeding is the genetic complexity of the species, which makes it difficult to identify and select desirable traits.
 However, advances in molecular biology and genomics have provided new tools and resources for sour cherry breeders, enabling them to identify and characterize important genes and markers associated with desirable traits. Rapid progress in third-generation sequencing technologies enables breeders to explore and exploit the genomic information underlying economical important traits. We used Oxford Nanopore Technology PromethION platform and R9.4.1 pore type and Illumina NovaSeqTM to sequence the genome of tetraploid sour cherry (Prunus cerasus). The genome and annotation visualization is permanently hosted at an assembly hub http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/private-hubs/pcer/hub.txt.
 The data on this platform includes 28 files, supporting the assembling, annotation procedure, and additional data used to characterize the segmental allopolyploid structure of the genome. 
 As a result, a genome sequence has been processed (20_WGS_PCE_2_0.fa). 
 The final genome sequence was annotated using Braker 1 and Braker 2 and the GeMoMa pipeline and 14 reference datasets from other Prunus species (Prunus_cerasus_families_fa.gz, genome_chr_fa_masked.gz, rm1_genome_chr_fa_out.gz, rm1_genome_chr_fa_tbl.gz, rm2_genome_chr_fa_out.gz, rm2_genome_chr_fa_tbl.gz, tsebra_braker1_2_gmst_v4_aa.gz, tsebra_braker1_2_gmst_v4_codingseq.gz, tsebra_braker1_2_gmst_v4-gtf.gz, final_annotation_1.gff). 
 The final structural annotation and protein predictions are provided for future studies (final_annotation_proteins.fasta). 
 The functional prediction was performed with InterProScan (Results IPS_PCE_A.xlsx, Results IPS_PCE_F.xlsx). 
 In addition, the sequences and annotation of the chloroplast (PCE_chloroplast_1_0.fa, GeSeqJob_20220901_192228_PCE_chloroplast_GFF3.gff3) and mitochondrion (PCE_mitochondria_1_0.fa, GeSeqJob_20230103_105327_PCE_mitochondria_GFF3.gff3) are presented. 
 Moreover, we used percentage of base coverage from rna-seq reads (RNAseq_avium.tsv, RNAseq_fruticosa.tsv), genomic reads (percentages_125.tsv) and % IAA (best_iAA_all_transcripts_PA_PF_only.xlsx, suppl_data_TabS5.csv) to evaluate the structure of the genome sequence on the occurrence of homoeologous exchanges. 
 We also determined the position of molecular markers (suppl_data_FigS5.xlsx) and LTRs (From_PCE_Prunus_avium_fna_mod_pass.list, From_PCE_Prunus_fruticosa_fna_mod_pass.list) on both subgenomes. Furthermore, the position of LTRs was determined on the genomes of P. avium (Prunus_avium_NCBI_fna_mod_pass.list) and P. fruticosa (Prunus_fruticosa_NCBI_fna_mod_pass.list).

Dominant Tree Species for Germany (2017/2018)

Abstract:
Spatially explicit and detailed information on tree species composition is critical for forest management, nature conservation and the assessment of forest ecosystem services. In many countries, forest attributes are monitored regularly through sample-based forest inventories. In combination with satellite imagery, data from such forest inventories have a great potential for developing large area tree species maps. Here, the high temporal and spatial resolution of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 has been useful for extracting vegetation phenology, information that may also be useful for improving forest tree species mapping. Thus, we generate cloud free time series with 5-day intervals from Sentinel-2 imagery and combine those with monthly Sentinel-1 backscatter composites to map the dominant tree species throughout Germany. Further, we incorporate information on topography, meteorology, and climate to account for environmental gradients in Germany. We use the German National Forest Inventory (NFI) as source for training data for a random forest classifier and for validation data to assess map accuracy. The optical Sentinel-2 data were downloaded, processes and structured in an analysis-ready data cube with the open-source software FORCE (Framework for operational radiometric correction for environmental monitoring; Frantz, D., 2019, doi.org/10.3390/rs11091124; https://force-eo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ last accessed: 02. Nov. 2022). The preprocessed Sentinel-1 SAR data was obtained through the CODE-DE platform (https://code-de.org/en/portfolio/?q=Sentinel-1 last accessed: 02. Nov. 2022) and included in the ARD cube along with the environmental data. We used Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 and environmental data from the two years 2017 and 2018 to generate the map with 11 tree species groups, including two broader deciduous tree classes (ODH: other deciduous trees with high life expectancy, ODL: other deciduous trees with low life expectancy), within the wooded forest area using a previously produced forest mask: Langner et al. (2022, doi.org/10.3220/DATA20221205151218). The reference data for model training and map validation is based on the third German National Forest Inventory which was recorded in 2011/2012 (https://www.bundeswaldinventur.de/en/third-national-forest-inventory, last accessed: 02. Nov. 2022). To exclude inventory plots where tree species composition might have changed in between 2012 and 2018, we used the forest disturbance maps by Senf et al. (2020, doi.org/10.1038/s41893-020-00609-y). The map accuracies were estimated based on a stratified estimator according to Stehman et al. (2014, doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2014.930207). Map accuracies were estimated for pure species stands in a first step and for the entire map, including mixed species stands, in a second step. The overall accuracy of pure-species stands is 87.07 ± 0.3 % and 75.53 ± 0.07 % for the entire map, including mixed-species stands.

Report of the Joint EIFAAC/ICES/GFCM Working Group on Eels (WGEEL)

Abstract:
The Joint EIFAAC/ICES/GFCM Working group on eels (WGEEL) met in a split meeting from 4–8 September (online) and 25 September–02 October 2023 (hybrid meeting) in Helsinki, Finland, to provide the scientific basis for the ICES advice on fishing opportunities and conservation aspects for the European eel and address requests from EIFAAC and GFCM. WGEEL assessed the state of the European eel and its fisheries, collated and analysed biometric data, reviewed the implementation of the WKFEA (Workshop on the future of eel advice) roadmap, examined available recruitment data from coastal and marine habitats, reported on any updates to the scientific basis of the advice, new and emerging threats or opportunities, including developments in the Mediterranean region. After high levels in the late 1970s, the recruitment declined dramatically in the 1980s and remains low. Compared to 1960–1979, the recruitment in the “North Sea” was 0.4% in 2023 (provisional) and 0.7 % in 2022 (final). In the “Elsewhere Europe” index series was 8.8 % in 2023 (provisional) and 11.3% in 2022 (final). For the yellow eel data series, recruitment for 2022 was 9% (final). Time-series from 1980 to 2023 show that glass eel recruitment remains at a very low level, with an historical minimum value in the North Sea. Silver eel time series have been analysed to identify patterns in abundance trends. These analyses are exploratory and have enabled us to test certain statistical methods and their limitations for analysing temporal series on silver eels. Although they give us an initial idea of trends in silver eel abundance, their results should be treated with caution. In fact, several problems have been identified and these points need to be improved in order to be able to interpret the results. The trend of reported commercial landings shows a long-term continuing decline, from a level of around 10,000 t in the 1960s, reported commercial landings have now dropped to 2028 (glass eel + yellow eel + silver eel) in 2022. The commercial glass eel fishery in 2022 was 60.1 t and 53.6 t in 2023. Reported landings from yellow and silver eel commercial fisheries (Y, S, YS) add up to 2914 t in 2021 and 2437 t in 2022. Spain was the only country allowing a recreational catch of glass eel, with landings estimated at 0.72 t in 2022 and 1.32 t in 2023. Reported recreational landings for yellow and silver eel combined were 240 t for 2021 (11 countries reporting) and 249 t for 2022. Progress with regards to the ‘road map’ developed within WKFEA was evaluated. The returns from the three questionnaires distributed by WKSMEEL to WGEEL members were summarised. In relation to the progress of the WKFEA roadmap, item 1; the inclusion of biological data is advanced with biometry data included in the annual data call. Item 2 relates to the reconstruction of the landings data and a workshop will take place in December 2023. Items 3 and 4 are also in progress, the Spatial database and Model for Eel (WKSMEEL) workshop was held in June 2023 with a follow up workshop planned for October 2023. A questionnaire for 3 topics (electrofishing, hydrographic network, and river obstructions & hydropower) was circulated to WGEEL members in August 2023. Of the 21 countries who responded, a large majority carry out electrofishing, have available hydrographic networks and hold some information of obstructions to migration. However, it was recognised that considerable effort and resources will be required before the available data could be collated.

Abstract:
Underway temperature and salinity data was collected along the cruise track with two autonomous thermosalinograph (TSG) systems, each consisting of a SBE21 TSG together with a SBE38 Thermometer. Both systems worked independent from each other throughout the cruise. While temperature is taken at the water inlet in about 5 m depth, salinity is estimated within the interior TSG from conductivity and interior temperature. No correction against independent data was performed for temperature. Salinity was calibrated against independent water samples. Finally, TSG1 was chosen for publication.

Dataset: InsectSound1000

Abstract:
InsectSound1000 is a dataset comprising more than 169000 labelled sound samples of 12 insects. The insect's sound level spans from very loud Bombus terrestris, to inaudible to human ears Aphidoletes aphidimyza. The samples were extracted from more than 1000 h of recordings made in an anechoic box with a four-channel low-noise measurement microphone array. Each sample is a four-channel wave-file of 2500 ms length, at 16 kHz sample rate and 32 bit resolution. Acoustic insect recognition holds great potential to form the basis of a digital insect sensor. Such sensors are desperately needed to automate pest monitoring and ecological monitoring. With its significant size and high-quality recordings, InsectSound1000 can be used to train data-hungry deep learning models. Used to pre-train models, it can also be leveraged to enable the development of acoustic insect recognition systems on different hardware or for different insects. Further, the methodology employed to create the dataset is presented in detail to allow for the extension of the published dataset.

Data set: blank values from heubach dustmeter-testing wheat

Abstract:
With the Heubach method free floating dust of treated seeds can be measured. The Heubach value is used as an indicator for seed quality. One way to make the heubach results more reliable can be the definition of the limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ). Blank measurements were conducted in several heubach labs for this data collection to allow a calculation of LOD and LOQ for the Heubach method. Wheat seeds were used for the contamination of the testing device. Two Tests (Data_LOD_LOQ_wheat.xlsx) were performed following the EU-Code of Practise for the monitoring of floating dust of treated seeds (Version 05.1, published by the Seed Treatment Stewardship Steering Committee (STICCS Group) on 1st August 2021).

Heavy metal contamination in European conger (Conger conger, Linnaeus 1758) along the coastline of Morocco

Abstract:
Background: In Morocco, fish is an important protein source especially, even not exclusively, for coastal communities and marketed fresh all along the coastline. One of the main targets of coastal artisanal fisheries is the European conger (Conger conger, Linnaeus 1758), a widely distributed benthic predatory species of a maximum weight of up to 50 kg. However, information on heavy metal contamination of conger is scarce. Therefore, concentrations of mercury, lead and cadmium were analysed in 108 European conger specimens from nine locations along the along the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Morocco to describe the spatial distribution of heavy metal contamination. Results: The average heavy metal concentration in all conger samples under investigation was 246.90 ± 216.83 μg mercury/kg wet mass, 74.14 ± 87.02 μg lead/kg wet mass and 255.12 ± 287.15 μg cadmium/kg wet mass respectively. Mercury and cadmium showed a clear site‑specific bioaccumulation in European conger but lead does not. Hence, the effect of fish length bias on contamination was corrected through a generalized linear model (GLM) prior to any spatial comparison. Conclusions: Different regional hotspots for the three analysed metals are identified and local sources are discussed. Mercury levels in big specimens of European conger exceeded the European threshold level for human consumption at some of the locations under investigation. Method: Hg determination Briefly, 2 g of muscle tissue samples were freeze dried using a lyophilizer (LD 1-2, Christ, Osterrode, Germany) and subsequently homogenized using an agate mortar or an ultra turrax tube drive dispenser (IKA, Staufen, Germany) to obtain a dry and homogenous sample powder. Total Hg was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using a Direct Mercury Analyzer (DMA-80, MLS, Leutkirchen, Germany). 20–30 mg of each sample was weighted into the boat containers of the DMA-80. Direct analysis for total Hg content was performed using a 10-level calibration. The limit of detection (LD) and the limit of quantification (LQ) were calculated from a standard curve according to DIN 32645 [12] with a confidence level of 99%. Considering the sample preparation, an LD of 0.08 μg/kg wet mass (WM) and a LQ of 0.23 μg/kg WM were determined for Hg. No values below these limits were found in any sample under investigation. Precision of the method was 8.2% and recovery was 100.3%.

Dry and fat-free sample powder (1–5 mg) was weighted and placed into the graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (GFAAS) ContrAA 600 (Analytik Jena, Germany) with a continuous source. The GFAAS was calibrated using a 5-level calibration diluted from certified standard solutions in 0.1 M nitric acid. Measurements were performed after adding 5 μg of palladium matrix modifier (Pd(NO3)2 in nitric acid) to each sample. The LD and the limit of quantification (LQ) were calculated from a standard curve according to DIN 32645 with a confidence level of 99%. Considering the sample preparation, a LD of 0.25 (2.61) μg/kg WM and an LQ of 0.74 (7.82) μg/kg WM were determined for Cd (Pb). No values below these limits were found in any sample under investigation. Precision of the method was 15.4 (6.0%) and recovery was 84.1 (96.1) % for Cd (Pb).

Calculations of gaseous and particulate emissions from German agriculture 1990 - 2018: Input data and emission results

Abstract:
In international conventions Germany has committed to the mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution. These international regulations (protocols etc.) are the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP), and within the European Union the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants (NEC Directive). These conventions require annual calculations of the emissions of the respective gases and air pollutants. The results have to be documented in an emission inventory and to be reported to the organisations in charge. The data file contains input data and results of the calculation of gas and particulate emissions from German agriculture for Germany and the federal states in the years 1990 - 2018. In this context the sector Agriculture comprises the emissions from animal husbandry, the use of agricultural soils and anaerobic digestion of energy crops. As required by the guidelines, emissions from activities preceding agriculture, from the use of energy and from land use change are reported elsewhere in the national inventories.

Measuring meat consumption with recommendations towards more sustainability

Abstract:
The broad public calls for a transformation of food systems and addresses a trilemma by emphasising environmental effects, but also referring to health risks associated with meat-heavy diets. In addition, citizens of many EU Member States are raising societal and ethical concerns with regard to livestock farming. Therefore, numerous scientific studies have concluded that a reduction of high meat consumption levels accompanied by more plant-based diets in high-income countries is a prerequisite for a shift towards sustainability. Efforts to achieve more sustainable food systems need to include approaches to lower lost and wasted food quantities along the entire value chain. This is especially relevant with regard to meat, considering the ecological footprint of livestock farming. Assessing the present situation and subsequently developing targeted strategies to reduce consumed and wasted meat quantities requires a comprehensive information base. Accordingly, this dissertation provides detailed information on average German meat consumption, individual meat consumer groups, and on meat waste within the German Hospitality and Food Service (HaFS) sector in relation to individual arising points. In addition, this thesis deliberates fiscal intervention and targeted marketing to curb meat demand, considering the specific purchasing patterns of individual household segments. It further derives measures for substantial meat waste reduction.The first article of this dissertation deals with an updated and revised estimation of the annual per capita pork, beef, and poultry consumption in Germany using a market balance approach and following a mass flow analysis. It includes a survey at slaughterhouse level, adjustments to external trade statistics, and assumptions of losses at the processing and wholesale level as well as of waste at food retail level and for at-home and out-of-home consumption. In this manner, an average per capita meat consumption of 64.7 kg is determined for the year 2018, comprising of 34.8 kg pork, 11.5 kg beef, and 15.8 kg poultry. These findings highlight a clear need for action as the identified consumption level is neither compatible with national health guidelines nor with international climate targets. In line with existing literature, results further confirm inconsistencies between per capita meat consumption levels according to food balances and self-reported meat quantities in the course of published surveys. But also, among supply-side approaches, international comparability of meat consumption levels is difficult due to different assumptions on meat utilisation and varying consideration of losses and waste. In order to establish a more consistent calculation of domestic meat supply in the course of food balances, the consideration of different meat types, edible offal, and by-products and the corresponding allocation of commodity codes for international trade statistics would need to be harmonised. Article (2) comprises an identification and characterisation of German household segments based on meat product purchases using revealed-preference data. A cluster analysis following a previously conducted principal component analysis reveals four different clusters: pork and beef traditionalists (59% of the total sample), convenience-oriented pork buyers (11%), poultry lovers (25%), and premium red meat lovers (5%). According to a multinomial logistic regression, there is heterogeneity with regard to the meat purchasing behaviour of these clusters. Therefore, they must be addressed with different priorities when aiming for a dietary shift. Results indicate that pork and beef traditionalists , and thus the majority of German households, does not adopt a “less-but-better” meat consumption, but rather exhibits meat-heavy diets. A tax on meat products could generally curb meat demand of these households, whereas more balanced diets of convenience-oriented pork buyers could additionally be encouraged by personalised price promotions of plant-based alternatives. Together with poultry lovers, they represent younger consumers turning away from high meat consumption levels. Due to the observed consumer heterogeneity, a change in the food environment including effective pricing measures but also a tailored product range accompanied by targeted labelling and communication campaigns could bring about a change in dietary behaviour. Results suggest that marketing strategies considering the meat quality perception of poultry lovers and premium red meat lovers in particular could promote a qualitative rather than a quantitative shift for these household segments. The third article determines an annual meat waste of 85,800 tons within the German Hospitality and Food Service (HaFS) sector based on computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and considers different arising points. A comparison of total waste quantities and waste ratios for gastronomy, communal catering, accommodation, and further HaFS businesses implies that leftovers including overproduction, buffets, and plate waste are a hot spot for meat waste within the HaFS value chain. Among segments, gastronomy and communal catering are main contributors to total meat waste quantities. There certainly is a potential for meat waste prevention since the prevailing share of waste consists of avoidable meat waste and implementing the waste management of the lower quartile (bottom 25%) of each of the four segments would lead to a waste reduction of 77%. A fractional logit model in addition to qualitative content analysis illustrates that both company-internal and government action might reduce leftover meat. Businesses being sceptical about donating edible food to social institutions reveal significantly higher meat waste ratios. Various companies perceive extensive legal hygiene requirements and organisational efforts as barriers which keep them from entering into long term corresponding cooperations. Communication measures which promote less wasteful behaviour in HaFS businesses need to address staff and guests. They should especially emphasise environmental effects of food and meat waste. Approximately 1,300 kt or 2% of the total CO2 equivalents emitted by German agriculture in 2018 could potentially be saved by applying the waste management of the lower quartile of each of the four HaSF segments to all HaFS businesses. Overall, results of this dissertation demonstrate a need to shift meat demand in Germany into a more sustainable direction. This is especially true, as meat consumption is on average not compliant with environmental and nutritional recommendations; the majority of German households has not yet turned away from traditional meat purchasing habits; and leftovers that are still edible in most cases are a hotspot for out-of-home meat waste. The three articles provide an important contribution to an improved database on meat consumption and meat waste. In the course of more comprehensive national nutrition monitoring, a regular collection of revealed-preference data covering out-of-home in addition to at-home consumption would make it possible in the first place to analyse the directive effect of legislative intervention towards meat demand management in more detail. A more comprehensive data collection should also be strived for in the course of the German National Strategy for Food Waste Reduction in order to assess the effectiveness of corresponding reduction and prevention measures. According to the Delegated Decision 2019/1597 of the European Commission, national authorities need to declare total food waste quantities without distinguishing between product categories or unavoidable and avoidable waste. With regard to meat consumption, future research needs to clarify whether there is a sufficient rational for more far-reaching legislative interventions from the perspective of behavioural, environmental, and welfare economics. Considering the individual household segments, studies should additionally examine the influence of a mix of instruments and look at the substitution between meat and alternative food products to assess possible rebound effects. In terms of food waste reduction, an evaluation of waste quantities with an ecological focus and an economic assessment of targeted measures could contribute to specify the declared reduction goals. This dissertation is among a growing number of scientific publications that draw attention to the issue of meat demand in the context of more sustainable diets. However, this topic is notoriously multifaceted and dietary strategies must balance national and international conflicts of objectives, e.g., environmental, health or animal welfare goals. Moreover, demand-sided concepts for industrialised countries can only be part of a superior solution since meat demand trends in developing countries give new urgency to the need for holistic concepts.

Pomological and molecular characterization of sweet cherry cultivars (Prunus avium L.) of the German Fruit Genebank

Abstract:
The German Fruit Genebank has been established as a decentralized network aiming at the coordination of the different germplasm collections in Germany to minimize the risk of losing fruit genetic resources (https://www.deutsche-genbank-obst.de/). Projects characterizing the genetic resources on trueness-to-type based on pomological and molecular characters are of main importance. First step is the characterization based on pomological characters. At least two experts, preferably members of the German Pomological Society, perform the pomological characterization. Second step of the characterization is a molecular DNA fingerprint analysis. Therefore, the European Collaborative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources (ECPGR; http://www.ecpgr.cgiar.org/) working group Prunus recommended a standard set of microsatellite (SSR) markers and a list of standard genotypes (references), which is routinely used. The Federal Office for Agriculture and Food on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture financially supports both steps: FKZ: 2809BE007, 2809BE011, 2816BE002, 2816BE004. 
 The genetic analysis was performed using 16 microsatellite (SSR) markers recommend by the ECPGR. Respective loci were amplified using three multiplex PCR assays and the generated fragments were subjected to capillary electrophoresis. 3,500 samples (fruits/ leaves) of cherry trees belonging to the German Fruit Genebank from six network collections were investigated. 383 different fingerprints could be estimated for sweet cherry by statistical analysis and 341 of them (89 %) could be determined in pomological terms.

Non-invasive method to measure the dermal exposure of amphibians to pesticides

Abstract:
Pesticide exposure of amphibians is difficult to assess due to the various possible exposure
 routes and the movement behavior between aquatic and terrestrial habitats (EFSA, 2018). In
 particular, little is known about the dermal uptake of pesticides in field, which appears to be
 very important for amphibian’s exposure risk and survival (Llewelyn et al., 2019). We have
 used swab samples to measure pesticides on the skin of amphibians which possibly originate
 from contact to contaminated soil, sediment, water, plants or air. We investigated adult
 amphibians, nine common toads (Bufo bufo) and one common frog (Rana temporaria), which
 were trapped in and around maize fields in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) in summer
 2018. About 10 cm² of the ventral and dorsal side of each animal were swabbed separately
 using individual sterile Dryswab™ with fine tip rayon buds. The selection of pesticides based
 on a proposal for a representative monitoring in the framework of the “Implementation of the
 National Action Plan on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides” (UBA, 2019). The substances
 were extracted with a solution of water/methanol (1:1, 1% formic acid) from the swabs. The
 amounts were measured with liquid and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We detected
 terbuthylazine in samples of three animals. Plant protection products containing
 terbuthylazine may be used in the pre- and post-emergence (BBCH 10-17) of maize with
 maximal 750 g/ha (BVL, 2018). The highest amount of 75 pg/cm² was found on the ventral
 side of a toad. This amount corresponds to 0.001% of the maximum application rate permitted

Data from: Deposition of dust with active substances in pesticides from treated seeds in adjacent fields during drilling: disentangling the effects of various factors using an 8-year field experiment

Abstract:
Residues of three neonicotinoid active substances (a.s.; clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam) were measured by means of LC-MS/MS following experimental drilling of treated seeds. Samples include plant material and petri dishes with filter collectors from fields adjacent to the drilled field, samples being collected immediately after drilling. Measurements are expressed in µg a.s. /m² and, only for plant material, µg/kg (one separate dataset for each measurement unit plus metadata table). Data result from a series of 13 field trials investigating the deposition of dust with active substances in pesticides from treated seeds in adjacent fields during drilling. Trials took place in Lower Saxony, Germany, from 2010 to 2017 and cover a variety of seed treatment products (Cruiser®, Elado®, Gaucho® FS 350, Gaucho® FS 600, Poncho®, Poncho Pro®), drilled crops (barley, maize, rape, summer wheat, winter wheat), adjacent bee-attractive crops in flowering stage (mustard, rape) and seed treatment qualities (Heubach a.s. values ranging from 0.00067 to 0.09074 g a.s./ha). The work was partly funded by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) as part of the German Diabrotica research program.

Video recording of the over the cow scenario for estimating dermal exposures during the application of a urease inhibitor

Abstract:
In cow cattle farming, the drag hose system application technique is used to automatically apply a urease inhibitor on the stable floor to reduce ammonia emissions. A risk assessment is required for using UI. As result, measured exposure data can be used to improve risk assessment models and better reflect reality. The video demonstrates a first methodical approach to estimating and calculating the maximum possible dermal exposure with the drag hose application technique and the worst case scenario over the cow on an life like cow dummy. In the investigated scenario, the life like cow dummy is placed in the direction of travel of the application unit. The drag hoses run over the life like cow dummy. Using the number of nozzles and the duration of their contact with the life like cow dummy, the maximum amount of liquid that could be applied using the nozzles' specified application rates (three times AirMix 110-25; twice AirMix 110-04 OC) was computed. The experiments were conducted under controlled conditions in the testing facility at Kiel University's Institute of Agricultural Engineering, where the drag hose system was installed.

Fatty acid analyses reveal differences in feeding ecology of North Sea squids that overlap in time and space

Abstract:
Climate-induced changes in marine ecosystems have been documented worldwide. As one of the main consequences, a shift in the distribution of species is observable in many marine areas, resulting in the formation of new species communities and new interactions. In the North Sea, the squid community has changed considerably over the last 100 years. Some species have disapeared while new species have established and are now living in coexistence in a new community. Although squids are considered to be predators that feed rather non-selectively, we aimed to answer the question of whether their diet differs nevertheless. Therefore, we analysed the fatty acids of three squid species whose distribution substantially overlaps. We were able to recognise a dependence between the size of the squid and the composition of fatty acids and are able to demonstrate the already known ontogenetic shift in food composition on the basis of fatty acid composition. Furthermore, we illustrate that the fatty acid composition differs significantly between squid species, which points to different prey of the analysed squid species and which may be one reason for their successful coexistence.

Calculations of gaseous and particulate emissions from German agriculture 1990 - 2021: Input data and emission results

Abstract:
In international conventions Germany has committed to the mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution. These international regulations (protocols etc.) are the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP), and within the European Union the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants (NEC Directive). These conventions require annual calculations of the emissions of the respective gases and air pollutants. The results have to be documented in an emission inventory and to be reported to the organisations in charge. The data file contains input data and results of the calculation of gas and particulate emissions from German agriculture for Germany and the federal states in the years 1990 - 2021. In this context the sector Agriculture comprises the emissions from animal husbandry, the use of agricultural soils and anaerobic digestion of energy crops. As required by the guidelines, emissions from activities preceding agriculture, from the use of energy and from land use change are reported elsewhere in the national inventories.

Reproductive data of Electrona risso, Melamphaes polylepis and Scopelogadus mizolepis from the Eastern Central Atlantic in March and April 2015

Abstract:
Knowledge on life history traits of mesopelagic fishes is still sparse. This dataset contains reproductive data of the myctophid Electrona risso (Cocco, 1829) and the melamphaids Melamphaes polylepis Ebeling, 1962 and Scopelogadus mizolepis (Günther, 1878). The specimens were collected in March and April 2015 during cruise 383 of the fishery research vessel ""FFS Walther Herwig III"" in the Eastern Central Atlantic. A pelagic midwater trawl (""Aalnet"", Engel Netze, Bremerhaven Germany) with multiple opening-closing device with three net bags of 20 mm mesh size and 1.8 mm mesh size in the cod-end container was used for catching fish at three depth strata per station between 50 and 700 m depth. Fish was stored in phosphate buffered 4% formalin solution and later on land in laboratories, specimens were measured, weighed, and dissected to examine gonads and oocytes under a stereo microscope. Reproductive phases were assigned based on macroscopic inspection following the standardised terminology for reproductive development in fish by Brown-Peterson et al. (2011, doi:10.1080/19425120.2011.555724). Histological cross sections of selected individuals were used for validation. The Gonadosomatic Index was calculated as GSI = 100 x gonad mass / (total mass – gonad mass). Batch fecundities were determined with the gravimetric method, counting the most advanced eggs in weighed subsamples.

Evidence of hybridization betweenn genetically distinct Baltic cod stocks during peak population abundance: PRJEB62422

Abstract:
Range expansions can lead to increased contact of divergent populations, thus increasing the potential of hybridization events. Whether viable hybrids are produced will most likely depend on the level of genomic divergence and associated genomic incompatibilities between the different entities as well as environmental conditions. By taking advantage of historical Baltic cod (Gadus morhua) otolith samples combined with genotyping and whole genome sequencing, we here investigate the genetic impact of the increased spawning stock biomass of the eastern Baltic cod stock in the mid 1980s. The eastern Baltic cod is genetically highly differentiated from the adjacent western Baltic cod, and locally adapted to the brackish environmental conditions in the deeper Eastern basins of the Baltic Sea unsuitable for its marine counterparts. Our genotyping results show an increased proportion of eastern Baltic cod in western Baltic areas (Mecklenburg Bay and Arkona Basin) – indicative of a range expansion westwards – during the peak population abundance in the 1980s. Additionally, we detect high frequencies of potential hybrids (including F1, F2 and backcrosses), verified by whole genome sequencing data for a subset of individuals. Analysis of mitochondrial genomes further indicates directional gene flow from eastern Baltic cod males to western Baltic cod females. Our findings unravel that increased overlap in distribution can promote hybridization between highly divergent populations, and that the hybrids can be viable and survive under specific and favourable environmental conditions. However, the observed hybridization had seemingly no long-lasting impact on the continuous separation and genetic differentiation between the unique Baltic cod stocks.

Bayesian Belief Network to explore combined effects of socio-political and climate change scenarios for an artisanal fishery in the Western Mediterranean

Abstract:
Worldwide climate change will influence the spatial distribution and status of exploited fish stocks, often in uncertain ways with cascading effects on social-ecological systems depending on them. Likewise, changes in socio-political conditions influencing consumer demand, fuel and fish prices may jeopardize the viability of fisheries. Predicting whether existing management systems can adapt to these changes is key and especially challenging in data-poor fisheries. In the Mediterranean Sea, the sub-tropical dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) is at its northernmost reproductive distribution area and has sustained a seasonal age-0 based artisanal fishery since ancient times. We built a quantitative Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model integrating a diverse set of ecological, social and economic input data to assess the impact of plausible mid-term futures (2040-2059) on the seasonal economic profit for dolphinfish fishers in Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Western Mediterranean). These future scenarios accounted for increasing sea surface temperature based on global IPCC projections, population dynamics and growth of dolphinfish, economic forecasts of future fish and fuel prices, and stakeholders’ views on feasible adaptations of the local management system. The model was built under the Horizon 2020 project CERES and it was fully parameterised with quarterly aggregated local fisheries statistics data. For details on the model development, parameterisation and use please refer to the upcoming publication in Ecology & Society or contact the lead author.

Dataset: survey about research data management in agricultural sciences in Germany

Abstract:
This dataset is the result of an online survey the authors conducted in the German agricultural science community in 2020. The survey inquires not only about the status quo, but also explicitly about the wishes and needs of users, representing the agricultural scientific research domain, of the in-progress NFDI (national research data infrastructure). Questions cover information about produced and (re-)used data, data quality aspects, information about the use of standards, publication practices and legal aspects of agricultural research data, the current situation in research data management in regards to awareness, consulting and curricula as well as needs of the agricultural community in respect to future developments. In total, the questionnaire contained 52 questions and was conducted using the Community Edition of the Open Source Survey Tool LimeSurvey (Version 3.19.3; LimeSurvey GmbH). The questions were accessible in English and German. The first set of questions (Questions 1-4) addressed the respondent’s professional background (i.e. career status, affiliation and subject area, but no personal data) and the user group. The user groups included data users, data providers as well as infrastructure service and information service providers. Subsequent questions were partly user group specific. All questions, the corresponding question types and addressed user groups can be found in the questionnaire files (Survey-Questions-2020-DE.pdf German Version; Survey-Questions-2020-EN.pdf English Version). The survey was accessible online between June 26th and July 21st 2020, could be completed anonymously and took about 20 minutes. The survey was promoted in an undirected manner via mail lists of agricultural institutes and agricultural-specific professional societies in Germany, via social media (e.g. Twitter) and announced during the first community workshop of NFDI4Agri on July 15th 2020 and other scientific events. After closing the survey, we exported the data from the LimeSurvey tool and initially screened it. We considered all questionnaires that contained at least one answered question in addition to the respondent’s professional background information (Questions 1-4). In total, we received 196 questionnaires of which 160 were completed in full (although not always every answer option was used, empty cells are filled with “N/A”). The main data set contains all standardized answers from the respondents. For anonymization, respondents’ individual answers, for instance, free text answers, comments and details in the category ""other” were removed from the main data set. The main data set only lists whether such information was provided (“Yes”) or not (“No” or “N/A”). In an additional file respondents’ individual answers of the questions 4-52 are listed alphabetically, so that it is not possible to trace the data back. In the rare cases where only one person has provided such individual information in an answer, it is traceable but does not contain any sensitive data. The main data set containing answers of the 196 questionnaires received can be found in the file Survey-2020-Main-DataSet-Answers.xlsx. The subsidary data set containing the respondents’ individual answers (most answers are in German and are not translated) of the questions 4-52, for instance, free text answers, comments and details in the category ""other” (alphabetically listed) can be found in Survey-2020-Subsidary-DataSet-Free_Text_Answers.xlsx.

Dataset to: Waterlogging effects on N2O and N2 emissions from a Stagnosol cultivated with Silphium perfoliatum and silage maize

Abstract:
In field experiments, perennial biomass crops emitted less N2O, a potent greenhouse gas, than their annual counterparts. To test if the perennial crop (cup plant, Silphium perfoliatum L.) has lower N2O emissions due to an increased reduction of N2O to N2 under moist to water conditions than an annual crop (maize, Zea mays L.), we conducted an incubation experiment. We incubated intact soil cores (35 cm height and 14.4 cm diameter) from a maize and a cup plant field and exposed them to increasing waterlogging in three consecutive phases (drainage, 1/3 and 2/3 waterlogged). Source specific N2O and N2 emissions were measured with the 15N gas flux method in an N2 reduced atmosphere. In both soils two N levels were established (60 and 120 kg N ha-1). N2O emissions from the cup plant soil were 33.6 ±78.1 mg N m-2 and 95.8 ±64.4 mg N m-2 higher than from the maize soil in the 60N and 120N treatment, respectively. With increasing waterlogging, in cup plant soil the product ratio of denitrification (N2Oi=N2O/(N2+N2O)) was lower than in maize soil. The results did not show N2O mitigation from cup plant soil, instead highlighted the complexity of plant-soil effects on denitrification. This study showed that the N2Oi varies widely in agricultural soils between annual and perennial cropping.

Calculations of gaseous and particulate emissions from German agriculture 1990 - 2022: Input data and emission results

Abstract:
In international conventions Germany has committed to the mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution. These international regulations (protocols etc.) are the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP), and within the European Union the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants (NEC Directive). These conventions require annual calculations of the emissions of the respective gases and air pollutants. The results have to be documented in an emission inventory and to be reported to the organisations in charge. The data file contains input data and results of the calculation of gas and particulate emissions from German agriculture for Germany and the federal states in the years 1990 - 2022. In this context the sector Agriculture comprises the emissions from animal husbandry, the use of agricultural soils and anaerobic digestion of energy crops. As required by the guidelines, emissions from activities preceding agriculture, from the use of energy and from land use change are reported elsewhere in the national inventories.

Dataset: Identification and validation of QTL for WDV (Wheat dwarf virus) resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum)

Abstract:
Wheat dwarf virus (WDV) causes high yield losses in wheat and other cereals. To date, there is little known about WDV resistant/tolerant varieties and no known information about genomic regions responsible for resistance is available. To identify the relevant genes, a panel of 500 wheat accessions (1-Plant material) was phenotyped after artificial inoculation in gauze houses for virus titer, infection rate, plant height, and yield parameters compared to healthy controls (2-Phenotypic data).  In addition, 85 T. aestivum - Ae. tauschii introgression lines, containing different chromosome segments of Ae. tauschii, were tested via greenhouse inoculation tests. Accessions with low susceptibility to WDV were found in domesticated wheats and wild relatives. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of a subpanel comprising 250 hexaploid wheat cultivars genotyped with the 15k iSelect chip (3-Genotypic data) identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for partial resistance. 
 To validate the QTL, biparental SSD (Single Seed Descent) and DH (Double-Haploid) populations were screened for WDV resistance and genotyped using the 25k iSelect SNP chip (5-Phenotypic and genotypic data of biparental populations).

sorcering: Soil ORganic Carbon & CN Ratio drIven Nitrogen modellinG framework

Abstract:
SORCERING can be used to model the fate of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON) and to calculate N mineralisation rates. It provides a framework that numerically solves differential equations of SOC models based on first-order kinetics. Thus, SOC models can be simply defined and run to predict the temporal development of SOC. Beyond this, SORCERING determines the fluxes of SON and N mineralisation / immobilisation. Basic inputs are (1) the model parameters of a given SOC model expressed as the C transfer matrix (including information on decomposition and transfer rates between model pools), (2) the initial distributions of C and N among model pools and (3) time series of C and N inputs and rate modulating environmental factors. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm is used to numerically solve the system of differential equations.

DC-EPG raw data on European spittlebugs and sharpshooters feeding behaviour on grapevine

Abstract:
The Direct Current-Electrical Penetration Graph (DC-EPG) technique was used to compare and describe the feeding behaviour on grapevine of four xylem sap-feeding species considered candidate vectors of X. fastidiosa and widespread in Europe: the meadow spittlebug Philaenus spumarius, the spittlebug Neophilaenus campestris, the rhododendron leafhopper Graphocephala fennahi and the green leafhopper Cicadella viridis. The four species were settled on potted grapevine plants for a period of 6 hours and the feeding activities performed by these insects, from stylet insertion into the plant to withdrawal were recorded by DC-EPG coupled with Stylet+d software. Characteristic waveforms were marked with Stylet+a software and analysed by the macro XylFeed. The raw data of the sequential and non-sequential EPG parameters generated by the XylFeed are reported in this database as part of the connected publication.

Evidence of hybridization betweenn genetically distinct Baltic cod stocks during peak population abundance - historical

Abstract:
Range expansions can lead to increased contact of divergent populations, thus increasing the potential of hybridization events. Whether viable hybrids are produced will most likely depend on the level of genomic divergence and associated genomic incompatibilities between the different entities as well as environmental conditions. By taking advantage of historical Baltic cod (Gadus morhua) otolith samples combined with genotyping and whole genome sequencing, we here investigate the genetic impact of the increased spawning stock biomass of the eastern Baltic cod stock in the mid 1980s. The eastern Baltic cod is genetically highly differentiated from the adjacent western Baltic cod, and locally adapted to the brackish environmental conditions in the deeper Eastern basins of the Baltic Sea unsuitable for its marine counterparts. Our genotyping results show an increased proportion of eastern Baltic cod in western Baltic areas (Mecklenburg Bay and Arkona Basin) – indicative of a range expansion westwards – during the peak population abundance in the 1980s. Additionally, we detect high frequencies of potential hybrids (including F1, F2 and backcrosses), verified by whole genome sequencing data for a subset of individuals. Analysis of mitochondrial genomes further indicates directional gene flow from eastern Baltic cod males to western Baltic cod females. Our findings unravel that increased overlap in distribution can promote hybridization between highly divergent populations, and that the hybrids can be viable and survive under specific and favourable environmental conditions. However, the observed hybridization had seemingly no long-lasting impact on the continuous separation and genetic differentiation between the unique Baltic cod stocks.

Working Group on Multispecies Assessment Methods (WGSAM; outputs from 2022 meeting)

Abstract:
The Working Group on Multispecies Assessment Methods (WGSAM) aims to advance the operational use of knowledge on predator-prey interactions for advice on fisheries and ecosystem management. This report presents an update of the multispecies SMS keyrun model for the Baltic Sea including its review by the working group, and the review of three modelling frameworks for the Georges Bank marine ecosystem. The Baltic Sea keyrun provides updated estimates of cod predation mortality for the Baltic Sea sprat and central Baltic herring stocks. The model integrates fishery and survey data on the two clupeids and makes extensive use of the cod stomach data (i.e. 64 000 stomachs are used as input to the model). Estimations of predation mortality are consistent with previous estimates and suitable for inclusion in the stock assessment of the two clupeid stocks. Predation remains low on all ages for both herring and sprat as a result of the low cod stock size. The large modelling framework for the Georges Bank comprises a multispecies production model, a multispecies length-based model and a mass-balanced ecosystem model. While none of the three models was at that stage to be evaluated as a keyrun, with further development they could complementarily and in conjunction contribute to the EBFM of the Georges Bank.

Copper distribution in German vineyards and its impact on soil organisms – Dataset of a field survey from 2010 to 2014

Abstract:
This data set is the result of a multi-year JKI field study in 10 German quality wine growing regions for realistic assessing the effects of copper content in soil and the effects of copper on soil organisms (earthworms and microorganisms) in viticulture. It presents the result of a field survey, which was conducted from 2010 to 2014 on a total of 78 plots. Among the 30 vineyards, 25 of them were organically and 5 conventionally managed vineyards. Among them there were partly vineyards with a very long management history (>100 years) and thus very high anthropogenic copper contamination, as well as young vineyards. To evaluate the resilience of expected negative effects on soil organism communities, former vineyards, now fallows, were included in this study at each site. These land had been out of cultivation for more than 20 years at the time of sampling (24 areas in total). Furthermore, uncultivated meadows were included at each site, which served as a reference of the investigated site without copper application (a total of 24 areas). For anonymization and in agreement with the farmers, the investigated area are not geo referenced. Only regions and area IDs are given, so that it is not possible to trace the data. The dataset consists 9 excel tables including data description, methods used and information on management history of all studied plots. The Excel file contains information on soil physicochemical parameters like pH-value, C/N, SOM, eCEC, heavy metal and nutrient contents in soil, with a special focus on copper, and mobile Cu contents from NH4NO3- and CaCl2-extraction. Earthworm data include earthworm species, earthworm abundance, biomass, and heavy metal contents in earthworm tissue. The dataset is supplemented with microbiological summary parameters of long-term respiration, microbial biomass, dehydrogenase activity, and metabolic quotient. The data will enable other researchers to perform statistical (meta-)analyses on the effects of copper on soil organisms.

Analyse des Liquiditätsmanagements in landwirtschaftlichen Unternehmen am Beispiel von niedersächsischen Milchviehbetrieben

Abstract:
Dairy farms are increasingly exposed to volatile prices for both milk and input factors in milk pro- duction. Price fluctuations in the world market are more strongly reflected in the EU internal mar- ket than before due to the gradual liberalization of the EU dairy market over the past two decades. In periods of low milk producer prices and/or high production costs, it is therefore a challenge for farm managers to ensure solvency in their businesses. Especially in the milk price crises of 2009/10 and 2015/16, milk revenues were often insufficient to cover the costs incurred. Many dairy farms therefore had to contend with liquidity bottlenecks or even situations threatening their existence or illiquidity, especially when no liquidity reserves were available. Against this background, liquidity management has become much more important alongside the business goals of ""profitability and stability"". More than ever, systematic planning, management and control of cash flows should be an essential part of professional business management. This is especially true for fast-growing or rapidly expanding dairy farms, which are often characterized by a high proportion of rented land, increasing outside labor and rising use of loans as a result of major investments. Such farms are mainly found in the dairy regions of northern Germany. As the demands on liquidity management in dairy farms increase, so do the demands on farm en trepreneurs. The entrepreneurial skills and attitudes of farm managers are seen as decisive factors in the development and orientation of farms and their handling of finances. Their professional qualifications and knowledge, coupled with their character traits, personality and attitudes are of importance. This raises two questions with regard to liquidity management, which are still largely unanswered in the prevailing literature: (1) Do dairy farmers carry out systematic liquidity management in their dairy farms and, if so, with which concrete measures? (2) What are the main factors influencing liquidity management, both at farm level and at the level of farm managers? The focus is on the entrepreneurial competencies and attitudes of the farm managers. This paper uses a mixed-methods research design to analyse, the status quo of liquidity manage- ment and its influencing factors in agricultural enterprises using the example of dairy farms in Lower Saxony. For this purpose, a quantitative survey is conducted in dairy farms, which is flanked by qualitative expert interviews and a final validation workshop. At the beginning of the paper (chapter 2), a brief overview of liquidity management and factors influencing liquidity management is given. In addition to various definitions, ""managing liquidity"" is seen as the ability of business managers to implement business management in such a way that the business can carry out all its activities in order to fulfill the company's purpose while always meeting its payment obligations on time. This conceptual explanation already includes the need to align liquidity management with the business's objective and the motives of the business's man- agement. Examples of indicators used to measure the liquidity situation in a business are the cov- erage ratio (ratio of cash and cash equivalents to payment obligations) and cash flow (balance of cash inflows and outflows). However, in addition to these measures of liquidity, the point in time at which a corresponding financial framework must be available is of particular importance in order to avoid liquidity bottlenecks (point-in-time liquidity). The core message and goal of successful liquidity management is the systematic planning, man- agement and control of cash flows. Only in this way can solvency in the business be achieved at all times and cash flow be used as economically as possible for the business. In order to identify possible factors influencing liquidity management, selected studies and data sets (test business network data, data from a consulting ring) are evaluated in addition to the lit- erature analysis and own theoretical considerations. Numerous scientific publications and data from official statistics deal with corporate success, usually profitability, and its influencing varia- bles. These are also used to derive factors influencing liquidity management. The influencing factors identified in this way are validated and further substantiated by practical knowledge in expert interviews (chapter 4). The factors influencing liquidity management are con- sidered at two levels (a) influencing factors at the farm level and (b) influencing factors at the farm manager level. a) At the farm level, these are: Farm size, legal form, location, structure (diversification), staffing, profitability, stability, capitalization, business relationships with banks. b) At the level of the business manager: Entrepreneurial competencies and attitudes. Based on the findings obtained from the literature and data analysis as well as expert interviews, hypotheses are derived as to how the influencing factors may work with regard to liquidity man- agement. For the following empirical analysis (chapter 5), based on the preceding analysis steps, a research model is first established to capture the complexity of liquidity management with its multiple in- fluencing factors. The empirical investigation determines the status quo of the liquidity situation in the dairy farms, records the measures of the dairy farmers for liquidity management in their dairy farms and identifies the influencing factors and ultimately serves to test the hypotheses. The study is based on a written survey of 1,131 dairy farms in Lower Saxony. The quantitative data analysis is carried out using simple and multivariate evaluation methods. The presentation of the results of the empirical study is divided into three sections: The first de- scribes the sample of participating dairy farmers on the basis of farm structure, financial situation and farm management. On the level of farm management, entrepreneurial competencies and at- titudes are presented. As far as possible, the surveyed farms are classified into the population of all dairy farms in Lower Saxony. In the second section a measurement tool is developed: The Liquidity Management Score. The aim is to make the liquidity management of the dairy farms measurable and assessable in a single var- iable in order to be able to analyze the farms with regard to their liquidity management. The score is developed with the involvement of experts and is based on a Delphi approach. The liquidity management score is an expression of the intensity of the liquidity management prac- ticed and comprises two dimensions whose measurement level is ordinal. The starting point is the two concrete measures recorded in the survey, ""Control of solvency"" and ""Cash flow planning"", which are statistically correlated and form the two dimensions of the score (with 5 ordinal catego- ries each). In the Delphi analysis, the 25 possible answer combinations were classified into four ordinal values of the liquidity management score with the aid of a traffic light scale ranging from red (no/low liquidity management) to yellow (medium liquidity management), light green (high liquidity management) and green (very intensive liquidity management). The distribution of the liquidity management score in the sample shows that 37% of the companies surveyed have very intensive liquidity management, and just under 10% have no or very low liquid- ity management. Overall, therefore, the sample shows a tendency toward ""more intensive liquidity management."" The liquidity management score is used as the basis for the further calculations and empirical anal- yses as an expression of the intensity of liquidity management. The third section of the empirical study identifies the factors influencing liquidity management at the farm level and at the level of the farm managers. In the first step, the possible influencing factors (both at the farm level and at the farm manager level) were examined individually in biva- riate statistical tests for their association with liquidity management as measured by the liquidity management score. Those factors that show a statistical correlation are taken into account for further analysis. In the second step, the interaction of these factors is the subject of multivariate investigations; this is based on the assumption that the influencing factors (at least in part) have a simultaneous effect on liquidity management - as already shown (schematically) in the research model. Using ordinal logistic regression analysis, the following factors influencing liquidity management are identified, recorded in terms of their impact strength (odds ratio) and confirmed: At the operating level: • Capitalization • legal form • Profitability • stability At the level of the farm managers: • professional qualification • strategic thinking • motivation • Ambition/goal orientation • propensity to take risks The results obtained in the empirical analysis are discussed in an expert workshop and interpreted with regard to their theoretical background, validated and further developed with practical knowledge. As a result of the multivariate analysis and the expert workshop, the factors influencing liquidity management at farm level in terms of their direction of effect are as follows: • Capitalization (measured by leverage): Dairy farms with a high debt ratio (>50%) have a more intensive liquidity management than dairy farms with less or no debt ratio. The reason for this effect is the bank-induced increased reporting obligation and also the dependence on the capi- tal provider, which subsequently lead to a more intensive control and also planning of the cash flows. Conversely, the companies with little outside capital have a low liquidity management, since there is less cause there. • Profitability (measured by ""satisfaction with the economic situation"" - as a proxy for profitabil- ity): Farms whose farm managers are ""partly/partially"", ""less satisfied"" or ""not satisfied"" with the economic situation of their farm have more intensive liquidity management than those who are ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with the economic situation. Since liquidity management is often only carried out on an ad hoc basis in practice, it is logical that in farms where the eco- nomic situation is assessed as unsatisfactory, the need for intensive liquidity management is seen and acted upon more than in farms where the farm managers assess their economic situ- ation as better. • Stability (self-assessment): Farms whose managers assess their farm (even in phases of low milk prices) as ""not stable"", ""less stable"" or ""partly/partially stable"" have a more intensive liquidity management in their farm than those who assess their farm as ""stable"" (robust, resilient). Here, too, the reason (analogous to profitability) is assumed to be occasion-related. • Legal form: Dairy farms in the legal form of a company have a more intensive liquidity manage- ment than sole proprietorships. The reasons for this are presumably the different farm struc- tures in the usually significantly larger corporate enterprises (higher proportion of leased land, borrowed capital and external labor, which must be fully remunerated even in financially diffi- cult times) and the necessary transparency among the parties involved with regard to financial circumstances. As a result of the multivariate analysis and the expert workshop, the factors influencing liquidity management at the level of the farm managers are as follows: • Professional qualification (measured by ""financial education""): Farm managers who consider themselves to be well trained in the field of finance carry out more intensive liquidity manage- ment in their farms than those who consider themselves to be rather/very insecurely trained in the field of finance. The background with regard to the entrepreneurial competence ""professional qualification"" (hard fact) is the assumption that among farm managers a combination of interest and skills leads to a higher value of the area of finance and thus to more intensive liquidity management in the farm. • Strategic thinking skills (measured by ""eliminate operating branches""): Farm managers who agree with the statement ""Operational branches that are not economically successful will be abolished or phased out"" with ""fully agree"" and ""rather agree"" have a more intensive liquidity management than farm managers who answer this statement with ""partly agree"", ""rather dis- agree"" or ""do not agree at all"". This result on the strategic thinking ability as an entrepreneurial competence (hard fact) of the farm managers in connection with liquidity management is critically discussed in the validation. Due to the nature of the survey question, the managers' wishful thinking may have overridden the answer (social desirability bias in the survey). • Motivation (measured by propensity for ""new ideas/improvements""): Farm managers who agreed with the statement ""I like to implement new ideas or improvements for my farm"" with ""strongly agree,"" ""tend to agree,"" or ""partially agree"" practice more intensive liquidity manage- ment in their farm than those who answered this statement with ""tend not to agree"" or ""do not agree at all."" The ""entrepreneurial type"" can be cited as background to the entrepreneurial competence mo- tivation (soft skill). If this is perceived as ""curious, willing to grow and invest,"" the associated companies are generally ""growth companies"" with above-average investments and compara- tively high levels of borrowed capital, which in turn goes hand in hand with relatively more in- tensive liquidity management. • Ambition/goal orientation (measured by ""making decisions easily""): Farm managers who agree with the statement ""it is easy for me to make decisions (also of a larger nature) in and for the farm with ""fully agrees"" as well as ""tends to agree"" have more intensive liquidity management in their farm than those who answer this statement with ""partially agrees,"" ""tends not to agree"" or ""does not agree at all."" The background to addressing ambition and goal orientation as an entrepreneurial competence (soft skill) of farm managers is the connection with the willingness to innovate and thus the implementation of investments and the raising of outside capital. This in turn is linked to inten- sive liquidity management (see capital resources). • Risk propensity (measured by ""acquiring a safety cushion""): Farm managers who practice more intensive liquidity management aim for a higher level of liquidity reserves or consider more fi- nancial safety cushions to be appropriate. This result regarding the attitude of the farm manag- ers was to be expected. It underlines the creation of liquidity reserves as the most mentioned and ""easiest"" instrument of liquidity management. These results confirm some of the hypotheses made earlier. Thus, the hypothesis on capital re- sources, according to which a higher share of debt capital in the business leads to more intensive liquidity management, can be confirmed, as well as the hypothesis established on professional qualification - ""the higher the qualification of the business managers the more intensive the liquid- ity management"". The two-part hypothesis on risk attitude - ""the more risk-averse the farm man- ager, the more intensive his liquidity management"" (including the formation of larger liquidity re- serves in the farm) - can only be confirmed with regard to the sub-hypothesis safety cushion (li- quidity reserves). In contrast, the sub-hypothesis on risk propensity cannot be supported statisti- cally; cause and effect direction in the expert workshop were discussed very controversially. The concluding discussion of the results (chapter 7) suggests that the chosen mixed-methods ap- proach (combination of three qualitative and one quantitative method) succeeded in achieving a higher significance of the results than with a single method (e.g. exclusively survey-based). How- ever, the written survey method has some limitations, especially in terms of capturing entrepre- neurial competencies and farm manager attitudes, as well as complex enterprises and diversified incomes. Future studies could benefit from a modified form of micro-level written data collection in this regard, for example, by combining written surveys and interviews with farm managers or supplementary data collection (accounting and other business records) from advisors of the sur- veyed farm managers. Based on the results of the study, recommendations for action are derived for various actors, in- cluding advisory services, associations and politics, science and the dairy farms. For advisory ser- vices (consulting), associations and politics, it is recommended to offer regular training and further education on the topic of ""liquidity"" and to develop guidelines on liquidity management. Pragmatic guidance and optimization similar to production topics is desirable. In terms of researchers, the research model used and the ""liquidity management score"" developed are suitable instruments for mapping the complexity of liquidity management. However, future research should focus on the further development of this score and other influencing factors. In- depth research into the risk attitude and risk experiences of farm managers is necessary in order to be able to analyze the cause and direction of effect with regard to liquidity management in more detail. Further interdisciplinary research should be carried out to identify the obstacles that pre- vent farm managers from systematically dealing with liquidity management and how these can be overcome. For the dairy farms themselves, it is recommended that liquidity management (planning, manage- ment and control of cash flows) be established as a permanent element of farm management. The appropriate time to implement liquidity management is during periods of high liquidity, when it is possible to act without time pressure with the help of advice. Continuous communication with lenders is essential. In the face of volatile markets, proactive and systematic liquidity management is essential for dairy farms in order to ensure constant solvency and optimize the use of cash flow on the farm. The necessary tools (e.g. computer-based liquidity planning, price hedging via futures markets, etc.) are available and are being further developed. They should be used (more intensively) by the dairy farms.

Working Group on the Assessment of Demersal Stocks in the North Sea and Skagerrak (WGNSSK)

Abstract:
The main impression in recent years is that fishing pressure has been reduced substantially for many North Sea stocks of roundfish and flatfish compared to the beginning of the century. Five stocks with agreed reference points (Category 1 stocks) have SSB higher than MSY Btrigger (haddock in 4, 6.a, and 20; plaice in 4 and 20; saithe in 3.a, 4, and 6; turbot in 4; whiting in 4 and 7.d), while the SSB of sole in 4, sole in 7.d, plaice in 7.d, and witch in 3.a, 4, and 7.d is just above Blim. Northern shelf cod (cod in 4, 6a, 7d, and 20) has one substock (Northwestern) with SSB above MSY Btrigger, one substock (Viking) between MSY Btrigger and Blim and one substock (Southern) below Blim. Several North Sea stocks are exploited at or below FMSY levels (haddock in 4, 6.a, and 20; plaice in 4 and 20; saithe in 3.a, 4, and 6; sole in 4; sole in 7.d; turbot in 4; whiting in 4 and 7.d); however, two stocks are being fished above FMSY (plaice in 7.d; witch in 3.a, 4, and 7.d). All substocks of Northern shelf cod (cod in 4, 6a, 7d, and 20) are fished above FMSY. An important feature is that recruitment remains poor compared to historic average levels for most gadoids, although there are signs of strong recruitment for haddock and whiting in most recent years. Recruitment in 2022 for flatfish stocks continues on a high level only for witch in 3.a, 4, and 7d, and for plaice in 4 and 20.WGNSSK is also responsible for the assessment of several data-limited species (Category 2+ stocks) that are mainly bycatch in demersal fisheries. The summary of stock status is as follows: Category 1: Cod (cod.27.46a7d20): Spawning-stock biomass of the Northwestern substock has been fluctuating above MSY Btrigger for most of the time-series and is well above it in 2023. Spawning-stock biomass of the Viking substock has been fluctuating between MSY Btrigger and Blim for most of the time-series and is just below MSY Btrigger in 2023. Spawning-stock biomass of the Southern substock has been fluctuating around MSY Btrigger for most of the time-series until 2016 and has been below Blim since 2017. Fishing pressure has been high throughout the time series but decreased sharply from 2018 and is currently above FMSY for all three substocks. Recruitment has been low for all 3 substocks, with the lowest recruitment in the Southern substock. Haddock (had.27.46a20): Spawning-stock biomass has been low since the mid of the 2000s but has increased sharply since 2019 and is now well above MSY Btrigger, Bpa and Blim. Fishing pressure has declined since the beginning of the 2000s, but it has been above FMSY for most of the entire time-series. Since 2021, fishing pressure has been below FMSY. Recruitment (age 0) since 2000 has been low with occasional larger year classes. The last 4 year-classes have all been above the recent mean. Nephrops FU 3-4 (nep.fu.3-4): advice in autumn. Nephrops FU 6 (nep.fu.6): advice in autumn. Nephrops FU 7 (nep.fu.7): advice in autumn. Nephrops FU 8 (nep.fu.8): advice in autumn. Nephrops FU 9 (nep.fu.9): advice in autumn. Norway pout (nop.27.3a4): advice in autumn. Plaice (ple.27.420): The spawning-stock biomass is well-above MSY Btrigger and has markedly increased since 2008, following a substantial reduction in fishing pressure since 1999. Currently, fishing pressure on the stock is below FMSY. After a strong recruitment (age 1) in 2019, the recruitment in 2020 and 2021 is estimated to be on an average level. Recruitment in 2022 is the second highest in the time-series. Plaice (ple.27.7d): The spawning-stock biomass has increased rapidly from 2010 following a period of higher recruitment between 2009 and 2019. However, since 2016, SSB has declined and is now at a level just above Blim. Higher fishing pressure from 2015 onwards and lower recruitment from 2020 onwards contributed to this decrease in SSB. Fishing pressure on the stock is currently situated between FMSY and Fpa. Recruitment (age 1) in 2020 is estimated to be the lowest value in the time-series. The 2021 recruitment was slightly higher. The lack of the UK-BTS survey in Division 7.d in 2022 resulted in high uncertainty for the 2022 recruitment estimate. Saithe (pok.27.3a46): Spawning-stock biomass has mostly decreased since the early 2000s and is currently above MSY Btrigger, Bpa and Blim. Fishing pressure has decreased and stabilized above FMSY since 2000. Currently, fishing pressure on the stock is below FMSY. Recruitment (age 3) has shown an overall decreasing trend over time but slightly increas-ing in 2022. Sole (sol.27.4): The spawning-stock biomass has fluctuated around Blim since 1996. Currently, SSB is estimated to be between Blim and MSY Btrigger (= Bpa). Fishing pressure has been fluctuating above Flim for a large part of the time series. In 2022, it declined to levels below FMSY. Recruitment (age 1) in the most recent years has been lower than the long-term average. Sole (sol.27.7d): The spawning-stock biomass has decreased since 2014 and is estimated to be fluctuating around Blim since 2017. Currently, SSB is estimated to be between Blim and MSY Btrigger (= Bpa). Fishing pressure has decreased since 2007 and is currently estimated around FMSY. Recruitment (age 1) is estimated to be on a relatively low level since 2012 and the 2022 recruitment is the lowest of the time-series. Turbot (tur.27.4): The spawning-stock biomass has increased since 2005 and has been above MSY Btrigger since 2013. Currently, spawning stock size is above MSY Btrigger, Bpa and Blim. Fishing pressure has decreased since the mid-1990s, and has been around FMSY since 2012. Currently, fishing pressure on the stock is below FMSY. Recruitment is variable without a trend. In 2021, recruitment (age 1) is estimated to be the lowest of the time-series. Whiting (whg.27.47d): Spawning-stock biomass has increased substantially in recent years and is now well above MSY Btrigger, Bpa and Blim. Fishing pressure has been below FMSY since the early 2000s. Currently, fishing pressure on the stock is below FMSY. Recruitment (age 0) has been fluctuating without trend, but the 2019 and 2020 year classes are estimated to be the largest since 2002. Witch (wit.27.3a47d): Spawning-stock biomass is now just above Blim but below MSY Btrigger and Bpa. Fishing pressure has been above Fyear classes since the beginning of the time-series. Currently, fishing pressure on the stock is above FMSY but below Fpa and Flim. Recruitment (age 1) has increased since 2016. Category 2: Brill (bll.27.3a47de): Catches declined sharply in recent years. The relative exploitable biomass (B/BMSY) has been above reference point since the beginning of the time series. Relative fishing pressure (F/FMSY) has decreased since 2000 and is currently below FMSY. Turbot (tur.27.3a): Catches peaked in the late 1970s and early 1990s and have been more stable in recent years. The relative exploitable biomass (B/BMSY) has been above reference point since the beginning of the time series. Relative fishing pressure (F/FMSY) peaked in the late 1970s and early 1990s, and has been relatively low without a trend in more recent years. Currently, fishing pressure on the stock is below FMSY. Category 3: Dab (dab.27.3a4): rollover advice. Flounder (fle.27.3a4): The stock size indicator has been fluctuating below Itrigger for the past 6 years. Currently, fishing pressure on the stock is below the FMSY proxy. Grey gurnard (gug.27.3a47d): rollover advice. Lemon sole (lem.27.3a47d): The stock size indicator has decreased since 2016, but is still above Itrigger. Currently, fishing pressure on the stock is below the FMSY proxy. Striped red mullet (mur.27.3a47d): The stock size indicator is well above the Itrigger. Cur-rently the fishing pressure on the stock is above the FMSY proxy. Whiting (whg.27.3a): rollover advice. Category 4: Nephrops FU 32 (nep.fu.32): rollover advice. Nephrops FU 33 (nep.fu.33): rollover advice. Nephrops FU 34 (nep.fu.34): rollover advice. Nephrops FU 10 (nep.fu.10): rollover advice. Category 5: Nephrops FU 5 (nep.fu.5): rollover advice. Nephrops out of FU (nep.27.4outFU): rollover advice. Pollack (pol.27.3a4): rollover advice.

Die Darstellung der Ergebnisse konzentriert sich hauptsächlich auf die Entwicklungen des deutschen Agrarsektors bis zum Jahr 2034 im Vergleich zum Durchschnitt der Basisperiode 2020‑2022. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die EU ihre Position im weltweiten Agrarhandel bis zum Jahr 2034 behaupten kann. Die Preise für Agrarprodukte sinken zu Beginn der Projektionsperiode vom hohen Niveau des Basisjahres, können sich bis zum Jahr 2034 jedoch wieder erholen. In Deutschland entwickelt sich der Anbau von Getreide rückläufig, was auf veränderte Preiserelationen sowie einen Rückgang der landwirtschaftlich genutzten Fläche zurückzuführen ist. Im Tiersektor setzt sich der in den letzten Jahren beobachtete Abbau der Tierbestände und Rückgang der Fleischerzeugung fort, insbesondere in der Schweinehaltung, wohingegen die Geflügelfleischerzeugung bis zum Jahr 2034 noch leicht wächst. Eine positive Preisentwicklung am Milchmarkt in Verbindung mit einer weiteren Steigerung der Milchleistung führen außerdem zu einem moderaten Anstieg der Milchanlieferungen. Das durchschnittliche reale Einkommen landwirtschaftlicher Betriebe geht über die Projektionsperiode um 17 Prozent zurück und liegt damit im Jahr 2034 wieder auf dem mittleren Niveau der letzten zehn Jahre.

LaForeT Governance assessments: Geospatial governance data of the LaForeT project

Abstract:
Governance has been assessed and mapped together with property rights in more than 70 community workshops in the LaForeT landscapes in 2017-2019. Participatory mapping was used to produce maps at the landscape level from the perspective of individuals. Mapping was carried out in workshops assembling representatives from the research landscapes. Polygons were delineated in focus group discussions on print outs of satellite images of approximately 80*120 cm. All mapped information was digitized by project staff after the workshops. Polygons of single governance arrangements have been delineated; governance arrangements were defined as spatial units with a homogeneous constellation of governance components. Subsequently governance quality as well as property rights were scored in focus group discussions for selected polygons by the participants. Governance assessments based on the World Ressource Institute's method ""Assessing Forest Governance: The Governance of Forests Initiative Indicator Framework“ (Davis et al 2013). Mean governance quality is calculated per polygon as the arithmetic mean of single governance elements including participation, law enforcement, institutions, forest management practices and tenure. Property rights based on Ostrom (1999). Mean property rights as arithmetic mean per polygon of single rights including access, use rights, administration, alienation and exclusion.

In the datasheet Data-LOD-LOQ-ZR (3) the Weight delta for Lab C, Employee B, Seed Lot 1, Number of measurement 8 had to be corrected (see in the datasheet, test 2, Column H, Line 110) correct is -0,00006 (former value: 0,00006). In the datasheet Data-LOD-LOQ-ZR (3) the Weight delta for Lab C, Employee B, Seed Lot 2, Number of measurement 9 had to be corrected (see in the datasheet, test 2, Column H, Line 121) correct is 0,00005 (former value: 3,00005). With the Heubach method free floating dust of treated seeds can be measured. The Heubach value is used as an indicator for seed quality. One way to make the heubach results more reliable can be the definition of LOD and LOQ. Blank measurements were conducted in several heubach labs for this data collection to allow a calculation of LOD (limit of detection) and LOQ (limit of quantification) for the Heubach method. Three Tests (Data_LOD_LOQ_ZR.xlsx) were performed following the EU-Code of Practise for the monitoring of floating dust of treated seeds (Version 05.1, published by the Seed Treatment Stewardship Steering Committee (STICCS Group) on 1st August 2021). The material and methods used are described in Material_and_Method.pdf and the procedure for estimation of LOD and LOQ for Heubach seed abrasion dust method is described in Procedure_for_the_estimation_of_LOD_and_LOQ_sugar_beets.pdf.

Working group on ecosystem assessment of Western European Shelf Seas (WGEAWESS)

Abstract:
The ICES Working Group on Ecosystem Assessment of Western European Shelf Seas (WGEA-WESS) aims to provide high quality science in support to holistic, adaptive, evidence-based management in the Celtic seas, Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast regions. The group works towards developing integrated ecosystem assessments for both the (i) Celtic Seas and (ii) Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast which are summarized in the Ecosystem Overviews (EOs) advice products that were recently updated. Integrated Trend Analysis (ITA) were performed for multiple sub-ecoregions and used to develop an understanding of ecosystem responses to pressures at varying spatial scales. Ecosystem models (primarily Ecopath with Ecosim; EwE) were developed and identified for fisheries and spatial management advice. The updated Celtic Seas EO represents a large step forward for EOs, with the inclusion of novel sections on climate change, foodweb and productivity, the first application of the new guidelines for building the conceptual diagram, inclusion of socio-economic indicators, and progress made toward complying with the Transparent Assessment Framework (TAF). We highlight ongoing issues relevant to the development and communication of EO conceptual diagrams. A common methodology using dynamic factor analysis (DFA) was used to perform ITA in a comparable way for seven subregions. This was supported by the design and compilation of the first standardized cross-regional dataset. A comparison of the main trends evidenced among subregions over the period 1993–2020 was conducted and will be published soon. A list of available and developing EWE models for the region was also generated. Here, we report on the advances in temporal and spatial ecosystem modelling, such as their capacity to model the impacts of sector activities (e.g. renewables and fisheries) and quantify food web indicators. We also reflect on model quality assessment with the key run of the Irish sea EwE model. The group highlighted the hurdles and gaps in current models in support of EBM, such as the choice of a relevant functional, spatial, and temporal scales and the impacts of model structure on our capacity to draw comparisons from models of different regions. The group aims to address these issues in coming years and identify routes for ecosystem model derived information into ICES advice.

StaPlaRes-DB-Thuenen - Three-year data set on gaseous field emissions and agronomic data in a urea fertilised rapeseed-winter wheat-winter barley crop sequence using inhibitors and subsurface placement at three sites in Germany

Abstract:
The database (StaPlaRes-DB-Thuenen) contains gaseous field emission as well as agronomic data and management activities for three years (2016/2017 – 2018/2019) from three field trials in Germany. The database stores 2.5 million records and was developed with Microsoft Access 2007-2016. The StaPlaRes project targets the mitigation of nitrogen emissions with two innovative urea fertilizer application techniques (nitrogen stabilization with inhibitors and subsurface placement “side dressing”). The resulting multi-variable data sets consists of gas concentrations (nitrous dioxide) and gas fluxes (nitrous dioxide and ammonia), crop parameters (ontogenesis, aboveground biomass, grain and straw yield, N content, etc.), soil measurements (nitrogen content, ammonium-N, nitrate-N etc.), continuously recorded meteorological variables (air and soil temperatures, global radiation, precipitation, wind speed), management activities (sowing, harvest, soil tillage, fertilization, crop protection, etc.), and its metadata (methods, further information about variables, etc.) for a three-year crop sequence / rotation. In addition to the field study, process-related investigations were carried out using lab (soil tests of nitrogen turnover, urease activity, NH3 volatilization potential), pot (nitrate leaching potential) and lysimeter experiments (nitrate leaching). Furthermore, N2 data were measured and analysed under laboratory conditions.

Datenerhebung zu Staubabrieb und Wirkstoffgehalt von gebeiztem Getreidesaatgut 2019

Abstract:
Um eine aktuelle Übersicht zur Qualität von gebeiztem Getreidesaatgut im Markt in Deutschland hinsichtlich Abriebfestigkeit und Wirkstoffgehalt im Abrieb zu erstellen, wurde von den Verbänden der Saatgutbranche (BDP, IVA, GFS, BDS, DRV, Seed Guard, DBV) ein Getreideringtest initiiert. In der Beizsaison Sommer 2019 schrieben die Verbände 32 Beizanlagen an. Es wurde um die Einsendung von Weizen- und Gerstenproben mit den Mitteln Landor CT, Celest, Vibrance Trio, Rubin TT und EfA gebeten. 138 Proben von 23 Beizstellen fließen in die Auswertung mit ein. Gemessen wurden der Staubabrieb mit der Heubachmethode sowie der Wirkstoffgehalt im Staub mittels HPLC.
 Die Methode zur „Heubach a.i.-Werte“ Ermittlung beruht auf der Wirkstoff Extraktion aus dem anfallenden Staubabrieb der Heubach Messung. Hierbei wurden je nach Beizmittel die Fraktionen: Filter und Dichtring oder Filter, Dichtring und Filterkörper extrahiert. Die Extrakte wurden mittels HPLC-DAD auf ihren Wirkstoffgehalt der einzelnen Aktiv-Substanzen hin untersucht. Die Wirkstoffgehalte der einzelnen Aktiv-Substanzen und den einzelnen Fraktionen wurden summiert und über die Einwaage des Heubachtest auf die Zielgröße mg (Summe a.i.)/180 kg Saatgut bezogen. Um den Wirkstoff im Staub vollständig zu erfassen und Wirkstoffverschleppungen zu vermeiden, musste die Heubachmethode weiterentwickelt werden.

Dataset: Identification of candidate genes associated with tolerance to Apple Replant Disease (ARD) by genome-wide transcriptome analysis

Abstract:
Apple replant disease (ARD) is an economic risk in apple production worldwide. Several studies on the response of apple plants to ARD have been documented, but less is known about the genetic mechanisms behind this symptomatology. The aim of our work was to find differentially expressed genes in response to ARD in Malus by RNA sequencing. For this, we compared transcriptome data of the rootstock ‘M9’ (susceptible) and the wild apple genotype M. ×robusta 5 (Mr5, tolerant) after cultivation in ARD soil and disinfected ARD soil, respectively. RNAseq of the 12 root samples resulted in 549.6 million raw reads, with an average of 46 million 100-bp single ended reads per sample. After quality control, 494.1 million reads were mapped to the apple reference genome (Malus ×domestica cv. 'Golden Delicious' v1.1) and assigned to 72,569 Gene IDs (Dataset 1). Comparing ARD soil versus disinfected ARD soil, 1,206 DEGs were identified based on a log2 fold change, (LFC) ≥ 1 for up– and ≤ –1 for downregulation (p< 0.05) (Dataset 2).

Maßnahmen zur Reduzierung des Pflanzenschutzmitteleinsatzes - Anpassungsoptionen, Kosten und Möglichkeiten zur umweltpolitischen Steuerung

Abstract:
Plant protection products are a significant component of conventional arable farming in Germany. They have helped increase land productivity and reduce yield losses, thereby providing a significant contribution to food security. However, plant protection products have negative impacts on biodiversity. Moreover, their degradation products can be found in ground and surface waters, and they are associated with negative effects on human health. Against this background, the aim of policy is to reduce the use of plant protection products and the associated risks. By contrast, the questions of whether and how farms can adapt their production systems and the resulting costs remain largely unanswered. Similarly, although the advantages and disadvantages of different policy implementation strategies for reducing plant protection products are discussed at both the European and national levels, the scientific publications are aimed primarily at introducing a tax model. A concrete comparison of different policy measures and an assessment of the adaptation reactions as well as the associated consequences, taking agricultural expertise into account, usually is not carried out. Against this background, based on a typical farm in the soil-climate region “Südhannover” and using a focus group approach with farmers and advisors, the present dissertation investigated which farm adaptation measures can reduce the risks to humans and the environment associated with the use of plant protection products by 25% or 50% and what adaptation costs result from such measures. The risks posed by pesticides were determined with the help of the Pesticide Load Indicator (PLI). In order to be able to quantify the yield effects as a result of reduced pesticide use, regional and national trial evaluations were consulted. In addition, the expected yield effects were differentiated between a best and worst case and a “normal year”. In order to reduce the PLI by 25%, farmers first will substitute less toxic active substances for those with a higher PLI. Similarly, weeds are increasingly regulated mechanically and non-selective herbicides are replaced by mechanical tillage before summer crops. If no crop-specific PLI reduction is required and alternative crops are available, farmers will substitute crops with a low net margin per PLI unit used (e.g. rape with grain maize). If the PLI is halved, reduced fungicide and insecticide use across crops or later sowing dates in cereals also are suitable for reducing the risks from plant protection products. With a crop-specific PLI reduction of 25%, changes in the net margin range from + 25 €/ha for sugar beet to – 60 €/ha for stubble wheat can be expected. If the PLI has to be reduced by 50% for each individual crop, the range of adjustment costs among the crops increases further. While the PLI can be halved for oilseed rape with costs of about 50 €/ha, the net margin for stubble wheat or winter wheat after silage maize decreases by about 150 €/ha. At farm level, the results show that the more adaptation flexibility farmers are granted, the lower the adaptation costs. With a 25% reduction of the PLI and taking into account the active ingredient substitution, manageable adaptation costs of between about 10 €/ha and 20 €/ha can be expected, depending on the adaptation flexibility granted. The change in grain units (GU) produced varies between + 4% and – 5%. On the other hand, the adjustment costs increase disproportionately strongly with a PLI reduction of 50%, so that an operational net margin reduction of between about 80 €/ha and a maximum of 125 €/ha can be expected. With a PLI reduction of 50%, the change in GU produced is between 0 and a maximum of -7%. As farmers are in competition with their colleagues on the land and tenancy markets, they usually cannot afford to voluntarily switch to production systems that cause lower yields or cost increases and thus put them at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis neighbouring farms. Policymakers therefore must change the framework conditions for all farms in such a way that the adaptation of production systems is either mandatory or economically viable. A wide range of policy measures are available for this purpose. Following on from the results of the adaptation costs, it therefore was examined how policymakers can use the ""PLI"" starting point to achieve their reduction target. In order to expose the selected policy measures and impact assessments to the critical judgement of the focus group, four concrete policy measures were developed that can achieve PLI reduction while addressing different secondary objectives. The measures examined include an individual farm PLI ceiling, a licensing system with tradable use rights, a state subsidy for low PLI hectare values and an increase in crop protection product prices depending on PLI. It was assumed that the policy measures would be introduced throughout the European Union. The effects that can be expected on production, farm incomes and the administrative and control costs for farmers and the state were worked out in an impact assessment. The following results emerged: In the case of a PLI ceiling for individual farms and at the same time for individual crops, every farm must, in principle, reduce its PLI use if it does not yet meet the targets in the initial situation. This leads to an area-wide risk reduction without shifting the production of individual crops to third countries. However, the adjustment flexibility for farmers is comparatively low compared with other policy options. The control is carried out with the help of an online database. In contrast, an increase in plant protection prices depending on the PLI has the advantage of not having to control all farms, but only ""bottlenecks"" such as traders and manufacturers of plant protection products. A disadvantage is the high negative income effect for the farms (> 220 €/ha) if the PLI is halved. In addition, readjustments of the levy level are to be expected in order to approach the reduction target. If the PLI use rights are distributed in a licensing system depending on acreage, it can be expected that crops with a high net margin per PLI unit used will be cultivated preferentially. On the other hand, crops with a low net margin per PLI unit used will increasingly be pushed out of cultivation. Farm managers can decide on the basis of the market price for the tradable PLI use rights whether to use them themselves on the farm or sell them on the market. As a result, it is to be expected that PLI units will be saved, especially on marginal arable sites where this saving causes only low costs. The PLI units freed up there move primarily to regions where an above-average net margin per PLI unit can be produced. These are classically favourable locations for arable farming. The comparatively high administrative costs required for tradability must be viewed critically. For the state, this additional effort goes hand in hand with the advantage that the reduction target can be targeted precisely. If the state decides to promote low PLI hectare values with a premium, a negative income effect at farm level can be prevented, as the farm only participates if its costs are lower than the premium payment. The acceptance of the policy measure by farmers is high. A major challenge, however, is the controllability, as there are high incentives to undermine the system.

Working Group on Governance of the Regional Database and Estimation System (WGRDBESGOV; outputs from 2022 meeting)

Abstract:
The Working Group on Governance of the Regional Database and Estimation System (WGRDBESGOV) provides the governance function for both the existing Regional Database (RDB) and the new Regional Database and Estimation System (RDBES) that is currently in development. It is composed of representatives from ICES Member Countries and EU Regional Coordination Groups (RCGs). In this report the WGRDBESGOV reviews the RDBES developments performed during 2022 and plans for the work required in 2023 and beyond. It also considers how RDB data has been used and proposes changes required to the current Data Policy. The RDBES is planned to replace both the existing ICES InterCatch and RDB database systems and has an important part to play in increasing transparency and improving the quality of stock assessment within ICES. To this end several workshops including training are planned for 2023 which will help data submitters with the transition to the new system. The work done during the year affecting the WGRDBESGOV is impressive, and the output is of a very high quality. Figure 1 describes the structure of the annual workflow WGRDBESGOV for 2023. During the WGRDBESGOV 2023, this structure will be evaluated, further improved and adjusted where relevant. The setup of the intersessional work during the last years, has increased the overall achievement for the RDBESGOV work significantly. During the WGRDBESGOV 2022, the participants became convinced that RDBES work benefits from being supported by several ISSG and that the way of working should be developed further and to be continued. The suggested ISSG for 2023 are described in Section 4 of this report: · The Core Group · ISSG FDI alignment with RDBES · ISSG Data confidentiality and data license · ISSG Data Quality (link to RCG ISSG Quality) · ISSG Funding and developments In addition, the following Working groups and Workshops have been proposed by WGRDBESGOV to support the RDBES implementation and are newly initiated or ongoing (Annex 2 and Annex 3): · WGRDBES-EST · WKRDBES-INTRO · WKRDBES-Raise& TAF2 · WKRDBES-Raise& TAF_Flow · WK TAF training The WGRDBESGOV works in coordination with the RCGs, to ensure that their needs are fulfilled. The WGRDBESGOV works in coordination with a number of ICES WG who provide technical support to the WGRDBESGOV in relation to different types of data (Section 3): · WGCATCH · WGBIOP · WGBYC · WGRFS To enhance and support the communication about the RDBES, to present clearer the tremendous work done, to highlight the need of the input of the ICES community, the approach as described and the infographic below, will be communicated to the RCGs including the National Correspondents, ICES ACOM and Secretary. In support of this, a short document will be compiled, including the roadmap and the main topics.

Dataset from the evaluation of raspberry genetic resources towards oviposition of spotted wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii)

Abstract:
The dataset contains the raw data of several experiments for the evaluation of raspberry genetic resources towards oviposition of spotted wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii). The data was generated in frame of the project ""Evaluation of raspberry and strawberry genetic resources for resistance to spotted wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii) as base for the supply of resistance cultivars to German fruit production"" from 2016 to 2019. The spotted-wing drosophila (SWD) is an invasive insect, which infest thin-skinned berries as strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, gooseberries and currants. Females of Drosophila suzukii attack fresh, ripe fruit by using their saw-shaped ovipositor to lay eggs under the fruit’s skin. The infestation occurs previously before fruit harvest and larval development makes the fruits unusable for marketing. The control of D. suzukii is difficult, due to restrictions of pesticide application before harvest. Recent literature reported different raspberry cultivar preferences of D. suzukii. One possibility of sustainable control of D. suzukii could be the cultivation of low susceptible varieties in soft fruits. Development of low susceptible varieties for breeding requires the evaluation and identification of donors possible for breeding purposes. The evaluation of existing genetic resources (varieties and wild species) is the basis for future breeding programs or cultivation practise. The aim of the project is the detection of phenotypic differences in susceptibility against D. suzukii in genetic resources of raspberry. Low susceptible varieties can then be used for breeding or recommended to German growers. We tested the oviposition of D. suzukii to the raspberry cultivar Glen Ample in seven experiments to test reproducibility of the method (raw_data_rubus_larvae_SWD__test_establishment_2017.csv). 
 Different ripening stages were evaluated for oviposition preference to D. suzukii (raw_data_rubus_larvae_SWD__ripening stage_201618.csv). A total of sixty raspberry cultivars were evaluated for oviposition preference (raw_data_rubus_larvae_SWD_20161718). Moreover, the sugar content and citric acid as well as the firmness were evaluated and used for a correlation analysis to mean number of larvae (raw_data_rubus_sweetness and titratable citirc acid_201718.csv; raw_data_rubus_firmness_201718.csv).

Dataset about dermal exposure measurements on a life like cow dummy with the collector Tyvek and the fluorescent dye pyranine

Abstract:
Ammonia emissions from cattle farming can be reduced by using urease inhibitors (UI). A risk assessment is required for the application of UI in practice, which involves exposure data. Fluorometry is the methodology used to measure exposures. The data provide an overview of the study of dermal exposure measurements on a life like cow dummy using the collector Tyvek and the fluorescent dye pyranine. Depending on the worst-case scenario, the cow was covered in regions where exposure is expected. Three different worst-case scenarios (over the cow, passing the cow, and 0 m frontal) were considered, together with two different application techniques (drag hose system and robot dummy). Exposure measurements were taken in a cattle barn under real-life conditions twice in 2022 (in May and August). In May, each scenario was carried out seven times, and five times in August.

Data set: Annually mulched wild flower strips increase the observed wild bee (Apiformes) species richness and abundance in vineyard fallows in the short term

Abstract:
The present dataset contains the complete list of bee individuals sampled for a study that investigated the effects of different habitat management treatments in vineyard fallows on bee communities. Bees were sampled in 10 vineyard fallows in the Moselle region (Rhineland-Palatinate, SW Germany), which were partially subjected to different treatments (mulching, sowing of wild flower strips, combination, and untreated control). In total, 9323 individuals from 140 bee species were sampled with hand netting and pan traps in 2013 and 2014. The list of bee individuals contains information on sampling details (site, treatment variant, date, time, method) as well as information on the collected bee individuals (operational taxon, determined genus and species based on morphological identification, sex). An additional data sheet contains information on the location of the study sites. This work was financially supported by the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) based on a decision of the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany, granted by the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE; grant number 2811HS003).

This is a correction of https://doi.org/10.5073/20230822-113751-0 published as version 1. In the datasheet Data_LOD_LOQ_ZR(2) the heubach value for seed lot 2 in g/100kg had to be corrected for lab E (see in the datasheet: test 3; column F, line 9) correct is 0,205 (former value: 0,021). With the Heubach method free floating dust of treated seeds can be measured. The Heubach value is used as an indicator for seed quality. One way to make the heubach results more reliable can be the definition of LOD and LOQ. Blank measurements were conducted in several heubach labs for this data collection to allow a calculation of LOD (limit of detection) and LOQ (limit of quantification) for the Heubach method. Three Tests (Data_LOD_LOQ_ZR.xlsx) were performed following the EU-Code of Practise for the monitoring of floating dust of treated seeds (Version 05.1, published by the Seed Treatment Stewardship Steering Committee (STICCS Group) on 1st August 2021).

PhenoApp

Abstract:
With the ongoing cost decrease of genotyping and sequencing technologies, accurate and fast phenotyping remains the bottleneck in the utilizing of plant genetic resources for breeding and breeding research. Although cost-efficient high-throughput phenotyping platforms emerged during the last decades for specific traits and/or species, manual phenotyping is still predominant and a time- and money-consuming task. Approaches that improve data recording, processing or handling are pivotal steps towards an efficient usage of genetic resources and demanded by the research community. Therefore, we developed PhenoApp, an open source Android app for tablets and smartphones to facilitate the digital recording of phenotypical data in the field and greenhouse. It is a versatile tool, that offers the possibility to fully customize own descriptors/scales for any possible scenario or the usage of pre-integrated ready-to-use BBCH scales for apple, cereals, grapevine, maize, potato, rapeseed and rice. Additional BBCH scales can easily be added. Furthermore, the simple and adaptable structure of input and output files enables an easy data handling by either spreadsheet software or even the integration in the workflow of laboratory information management systems (LIMS). The embedding in international information standards such as MIAPPE or the implementation regarding FAIR data principles is feasible. PhenoApp is a decisive contribution to increase efficiency of digital data acquisition in breeding, breeding research and genebank management by accelerating the labor intensive and time-consuming acquisition of phenotyping data.

Mercury and explosive compound 4-aminodinitrotoluene (4-ADNT) in dab (Limanda limanda) caught at munition dumping site Kolberger Heide in the Kiel Bight, Baltic Sea

Abstract:
Dumped munitions contain various harmful substances which can affect marine biota like fish. One of them is mercury (Hg), included in the common explosive primer. Another is 4-aminodinitrotoluene (4-ADNT), an explosive-metabolite. 251 individual dab (Limanda limanda L.) caught at the dump site Kolberger Heide a and nearby reference sites in 2017 and 2018 were analysed. The table contain individual data on Hg, 4-aminodinitrotoluene, age, length, weight, sex and condition factor. Mercury at AAS For sample preparation, portions of muscle samples were freeze dried using a lyophilizer and subsequently homogenized using an agate mortar or an ultra turrax tube drive dispenser (IKA, Staufen, Germany) equipped with glass grinders respectively to obtain a dry sample powder suitable for Hg analysis. Total Hg was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using a Direct Mercury Analyzer (DMA-80, MLS, Leutkirchen, Germany). Known amounts (20–30 mg) of each sample were weighted into the boat containers (precleaned with nitric acid) of the DMA-80. Direct analysis for total Hg content was performed using a 10-level calibration with standards in 0.5 M nitric acid. The accuracy of the procedure was determined by analysis of Certified Reference Material (DORM-3 and DORM-4, both fish protein homogenates) obtained from the National Research Council (NCR) in Canada which was taken through the same analytical procedure as the samples. Details on reference materials are given in Table 1. All samples were analysed in triplicate. External quality assurance was done by successfully participation in laboratory proficiency tests (z-score 0.7) conducted by QUASIMEME (www.wepal.nl) designed for marine environment analytics. The limit of detection (LD) and the limit of quantification (LQ) were calculated from a standard curve according to DIN 32,645 (DIN, 1994) with a confidence level of 99%. Considering the sample preparation, a LD of 0.080 µg/kg wet weight (w. w.) and a LQ of 0.230 µg/kg w. w. were determined for Hg. No values below these limits were found in any sample under investigation. Recovery of the method was 100.3% and precision was 8.20%. Explosives at LC-MS/MS 5 μL of the final bile extract were injected on a column in an Agilent 1290 Infinity High-Performance-Liquid-Chromatograph coupled to an AB Sciex QTrap 5500 Triple Quadrupole/Ion-Trap Mass Spectrometer (HPLC-MS). Gradient separation was achieved using an Acclaim Explosives E2 Column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) kept at 22 °C. Ionization was conducted in negative atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) mode. Explosives and selected metabolites were detected via a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode based on characteristic MS/MS transitions, previously optimized using commercially available standard substances. Characterisation of unknown compounds was achieved in scan-mode of the linear ion trap by selecting nitroaromatic compounds using a neutral loss scan targeting the loss of nitro-groups (m/z 46), followed by an enhanced product ion scan, producing a sensitive mass spectrum of the nitro-containing molecule. Abundances of explosive compounds were quantified via the internal standard 1,4-DNB and corrected for response factors. Response factors were determined using an external calibration covering the expected range of concentrations. The method used is described in detail by Koske et al. (2019). Limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantitation (LOQ) for explosive compounds were calculated according to DIN 32645 (2008). LOD 4-ADNT: 2.8 ng/ml bile. LOQ 4-ADNT: 18.8 ng/ml bile.

Data set: blank values from heubach dustmeter-testing maize, barley and onion

Abstract:
With the Heubach method free floating dust of treated seeds can be measured. The Heubach value is used as an indicator for seed quality. One way to make the heubach results more reliable can be the definition of the limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ). Blank measurements were conducted in several heubach labs for this data collection to allow a calculation of LOD and LOQ for the Heubach method. For the conditioning of the testing device seeds from maize, barley and onion were used. Two Tests (Data_LOD_LOQ_barley_maize_onion.xlsx) were performed following the EU-Code of Practise for the monitoring of floating dust of treated seeds (Version 05.1, published by the Seed Treatment Stewardship Steering Committee (STICCS Group) on 1st August 2021). The material and methods used are described in Material_and_methods_maize_barley_onion.pdf and the procedure for estimation of LOD and LOQ for Heubach seed abrasion dust method is described in Procedure_for_the_estimation_of_LOD_and_LOQ_maize_barley_onion.pdf.

Produktionsökonomische Analyse von Tierwohlmaßnahmen in typischen Milchviehbetrieben Nordwestdeutschlands

Abstract:
Farm animal husbandry is the most important sector of the German agriculture and food industry. With an overall share of 22 percent of the production value of agriculture, milk production is of particularly great economic importance and dairy cows are kept on every fifth farm. However, the husbandry practices for dairy cows in Germany are subject to increasing criticism. Insufficient space per animal or a lack of grazing possibilities are regular critiques. There is also scientific evidence of deficits in animal welfare in dairy farming. The legal framework for dairy farming in Germany is relatively unspecific. Whereas specific requirements are laid down in the Animal Welfare Husbandry Ordinance (German: Tierschutz-Nutztierhaltungsverordnung) for keeping poultry and pigs, these are lacking for dairy cattle farming. In addition, farm structures and husbandry conditions are highly heterogeneous. For example, on 24 percent of the farms – predominantly on very small farms – the dairy cows are kept in year-round tethered housing. From a professional, scientific perspective, these conditions lead to major restrictions on natural behaviour. However, deficits in animal welfare were also found on farms with loose housing, with a wide variation between farms. Various market participants have already established animal welfare programs in response to consumer demands for better animal welfare. These usually include a minimum level of resource-related requirements (e.g., space allowance, box length, etc.). However, the products produced in these animal welfare programs have only a small market share. This can be attributed to two main reasons: Firstly, the other market participants' counter-financing of the additional costs is not guaranteed. Secondly, studies show that many consumers do not accept high price premiums for a higher level of animal welfare, even though the issue of animal welfare is given high priority in opinion polls. Voluntary labels, therefore, do not consequently lead to a higher level of animal welfare. The German Federal Ministry of Agriculture appointed the Competence Network Livestock Husbandry (German: Kompetenznetzwerk Nutztierhaltung (KNW)) to solve this dilemma. The KNW presented its recommendations for the sector's future development in 2020. These include introducing three animal welfare levels with a simultaneous gradual increase in the legal requirements for farm animal husbandry. In order not to endanger the competitiveness of German livestock farming and to prevent migration of livestock farming to countries with lower animal welfare standards, the additional costs associated with implementing the animal welfare levels are to be offset by a state animal welfare premium and investment support. The recommendations provide for the following three husbandry levels: • Level 1: ""Stable plus"", with a larger space, activity material, etc. • Level 2: ""Improved stables"", with additional space, climate incentives, etc. • Level 3: ""Premium"", with the most space, outdoor runs or pasture, etc. The recommendations of the KNW envisage that Level 1 will become the legal minimum standard for livestock farming from the year 2030 and Level 2 from the year 2040. The detailed design of the levels with criteria was carried out by the KNW's cattle working group - an expert group for cattle farming. At present, it is not foreseeable how the KNW's proposals will be taken up by policymakers and implemented in concrete terms. Initially, the political discussion will focus on implementing the recommendations for transforming pig farming, other types of livestock will follow. Concerning a possible implementation for the transformation of dairy farming, it is essential to know (1) how dairy farms can adapt to the criteria of the cattle working group, (2) what effects these adaptations have on the husbandry system and production costs, and (3) what further optimisation of the criteria could look like. This thesis investigates these questions using a socio-economic mix of methods based on the example of dairy farms in the grassland regions of northwest Germany.   Five methodological approaches were combined for this purpose: (1) Using data from the 2010 agricultural census and the 2016 agrarian structure survey, dairy farms in northwest Germany were classified into different farm clusters as part of a cluster analysis. (2) Using the concept of typical farms, typical regional farms were developed from the structural critical data of the farm clusters. (3) Focus group discussions were conducted with farmers from the study region to determine and coordinate consistent, detailed production-economic data of the typical farms. These focus group discussions were then used to select and plan adaptation options to the criteria set by the cattle working group. An iterative approach was chosen in which the results of the first focus group discussion were evaluated and adapted in a second round of discussions. (4) The results of the focus group discussions were evaluated with the help of the individual farm calculation model TIPI-CAL. Two tools were added to the model to map resource-related and management-related adjustments to the production system. (5) The results of the previous investigations were discussed with livestock scientists in an expert workshop to evaluate individual animal welfare measures for achieving the various levels and to derive optimisation potential for the further design of the levels. Based on a cluster analysis of the agricultural structure data and within the framework of the first focus group discussion, three typical farms were built, based on which the effects of the criteria set by the KNW cattle working group were examined: • The typical farm DE-55_NWD represents the most common farm type in the region. In the cluster analysis, 59 percent of the farms in the study region were assigned to this cluster. The farm has 55 dairy cows and did not grow between 2010 and 2016. It is the smallest of the three typical farms. The primary production system is based on a free-stall barn from the 1980s, renovated in the early 2000s. • The typical farm DE-140_NWD represents a medium-sized farm for the study region with 140 dairy cows. The lactating dairy cows are kept in a free-stall barn built in the 2010s. The production system is comparatively modern, and its basic features meet the regional recommendations for animal welfare in dairy cow husbandry. A total of 38 percent of the farms were assigned to this type in the cluster analysis. Between 2010 and 2016, moderate growth of the dairy herd took place on the farm. • The large farms in the study region are represented by the typical farm DE-330_NWD, which keeps 330 dairy cows. The production system was also built in the 2010s, similar to the typical farm DE-140_NWD, and also complies with the regional recommendations for animal welfare in dairy cow husbandry. The cluster of large farms represents three percent of the farms in the study region. The typical farm represents a farm that increased the herd size by about 120 dairy cows between 2010 and 2016. The necessary adaptions on the typical farms to the levels of the cattle working group vary greatly. Extensive adaptations are required on all typical farms to transfer the existing production system to Level 1. These adaptations are most comprehensive on the small farm DE-55_NWD. The requirements cannot be implemented in the existing barn. This farm can therefore only be transferred to Level 1 through a completely new barn construction. This leads to adaptation costs in the small typical farm of 2.48 cents per kilogram of energy-corrected milk (ECM). However, comprehensive adjustments are also necessary on the other two typical farms, many of which cannot be implemented within the existing production system. On both farms, cubicle spaces within the existing barn building must be dismantled and installed in an extension because of the requirement to allow a transition between walking and feeding aisles after a maximum of 13 cubicles. As a result, the additional costs for implementing Level 1 amount to 1.23 cents per kilogram ECM in the medium-sized farm DE-140_NWD and 0.74 cents per kilogram ECM in the large farm DE-330_NWD. A large part of the requirements in Level 2 correspond to those of Level 1 or are only slightly above this level, which is why the adaptation measures on the typical farms in both levels are mostly similar. Since Level 2 contains additional requirements likely to have a performance-enhancing effect, additional revenues offset the additional costs. Consequently, the additional costs for the small typical farm DE-55_NWD to obtain Level 2 amount to 2.48 cents per kilogram of ECM, similar to Level 1. On the two larger farms, the impact of the increase in output is even higher. On farm DE-140_NWD, the additional costs in Level 2 amount to 1.10 cents per kilogram of ECM; on farm DE-330_NWD, they amount to 0.65 cents per kilogram of ECM. This means the additional costs on the two larger farms are lower than those for Level 1. Level 3 comprises the most extensive requirements for the housing of dairy cows. Among other things, this includes keeping dairy cows on pasture for at least 120 days per year. This criterion is not easily feasible for the typical farm DE-330_NWD due to the herd size and the site conditions of the study region. Therefore, a direct adaptation option to Level 3 for large farms could not be identified by the focus groups. In the long term, it would be theoretically possible to implement Level 3 in large herd sizes by splitting them across different sites. Due to the comparatively high resource-related requirements of Level 3, both for the stables and grazing, the calculated additional costs and revenue changes on the other two typical farms are significantly higher than those of the previous levels. On farm DE-55_NWD, they are highest at 9.95 cents per kilogram ECM; on the medium-sized farm, DE-140_NWD, they amount to 6.72 cents per kilogram ECM. In addition to the high costs for the conversion and new construction of the housing system, a reduction in milk yield is expected which will cause a decrease in revenue and an increase in costs per kilogram of ECM. The costs incurred in adapting to the cattle working group levels on the typical farms vary between the farms and the levels. From the focus group discussions, it emerged that Level 1 is not an attractive adaptation strategy for any of the typical farms since, on the one hand, it incurs very high costs compared to Level 2 and, on the other hand, it cannot be considered as a long-term perspective if the legal eligibility of Level 1 ends in 2040, well before the end of the depreciation period. Farms represented by the typical farm DE-55_NWD already face an economically challenging initial situation and unclear development perspectives. Therefore, it is yet to discuss whether they should participate in the KNW concept at all, or whether a (possibly premature) production exit from 2030 onwards might be the consequence. Not only for the small typical farm the available calculations show that from Level 1 onwards extensive adjustments are necessary in all farm types, leading to high additional costs. This raises the question of whether it is possible to modify the criteria so that the implementation causes lower costs but a similar animal welfare level. For this purpose, the animal welfare contribution of the individual criteria was discussed with farm animal ethologists in the framework of an expert workshop, and whether there are more cost-effective possibilities for adaptation through adjusting the criteria. The expert workshop identified basic correlations between different measures for fulfilling the required criteria and the resulting animal welfare contributions. However, evaluating these individual measures proved to be a considerable challenge. As there are interactions between the individual measures, removing single requirements from the criteria would not make sense. Therefore, the levels or bundled measures must be considered in a holistic approach. As a result, the livestock scientists could not agree on a cost-benefit matrix for alternative requirement criteria. However, based on the interaction discussed in the expert workshop, potential alternative criteria for Level 1 were conceived, and respective adaptation scenarios were simulated. The alternative criteria include changes regarding the widths of feeding and walking aisles, which are the main reasons the typical farm DE-55_NWD cannot be transferred to Level 1 without major reconstruction of the production system. To compensate for the insufficient width of the feeding and walking aisles in the existing barn, transitions between walking and feeding aisles after only 10 cubicles are required as an alternative criterion. On the typical farms, DE-140_NDW and DE-330_NWD, the changes in the criteria also refer to the transitions between walking and feeding aisles. However, these were increased to up to 20 cubicles, as more comprehensive walking and feeding aisles were already present in the initial situation. These two changes – while retaining all other criteria – lead to a significant reduction in the extent of barn adaption, especially in the typical farms, DE-140_NWD and DE-330_NWD. The adaptation costs of the typical farms are significantly affected by the change in these criteria. In farm DE-55_NWD, the additional costs can be reduced with lower aisle width requirements by 37 percent to 1.56 cents per kilogram of ECM. In farms DE-140_NWD and DE-330_NWD, the potential for cost reduction is even higher. The adaption costs for farm DE-140_NWD are reduced by 54 percent to 0.56 cents per kilogram ECM, in the case of farm DE-330_NWD even to 0.16 cents per kilogram ECM, which corresponds to a reduction of 78 percent compared to the adjustment costs to the original criteria of the cattle working group for level 1. Several conclusions can be drawn from the results of the production economics studies, the expert workshop, and the subsequent sensitivity analysis of the adaptation options: • In the study, the levels designed by the cattle working group did not prove to be an attractive way to participate in an animal welfare program. They showed constructive weaknesses, especially with regard to the design of Level 1. The focus group farmers consider this an unattractive entry point into the animal welfare program. The fact that the additional costs for Level 1 on two of the typical farms are higher than the additional costs for Level 2 – and thus more money would have to be spent for ""less"" animal welfare – will be challenging to communicate to the funders or citizens. • Since extensive structural adaptations are already necessary for typical farms in Level 1, it can be assumed that dept capital will be required for this. If Level 1 is no longer permitted from 2040, as planned by the KNW, this would mean that the depreciation period would extend beyond the useful life. This makes the financing of Level 1 fundamentally uncertain for farmers. • Farms with older production systems are particularly affected. The barns' aisle widths are usually insufficient to meet the criteria of Level 1. In the study region, this mainly affects smaller farms. However, in other areas, such as eastern Germany, much larger farms operating in older barns would also be affected. While the criteria of the cattle working group allow farms with tethered housing to continue using their housing systems until 2040, farms with older free-stall systems do not have this option without major modifications. This cannot be easily explained to farmers and society. • The results of this thesis show that the design of animal welfare policy can directly impact agricultural structural policy. For example, a consistent application of the criteria of the cattle working group could lead to a substantial abandonment of dairy farms immediately before the year 2030 if Level 1 is made mandatory in 2030. In this case, decision-makers would have to balance whether to accept the cattle working group's proposal for the level design or to revise the criteria so that existing barns – as initially envisaged by the KNW for Level 1 – can participate in the KNW concept without extensive conversion measures. • The criteria of the cattle working group is very extensive, with a high level of detail for the resource-related requirements. The criteria of other animal welfare programs and labels that are already available on the market mainly include less detailed requirements. The conditions for organic farming, for example, are less restrictive and are even lower than the requirements for Level 1 in some cases. Therefore, it is necessary to check whether an animal welfare standard corresponding to the KNW objectives can be achieved with already implemented animal welfare programs. The effectiveness of these programs could be examined based on animal welfare-related indicator sets. This would aim to obtain indications for further optimising the cattle working group criteria for dairy cows. The socio-economic method mix used in this study consists of a cluster analysis of the agricultural structure data, the concept of typical farms, and focus group discussions. Individual farm analysis proved helpful in answering the question of how dairy farms in the study region can adapt to the criteria of the cattle working group and what costs are associated with this. In addition, optimising potentials for the further design of the criteria could be derived from the study. However, no concrete alternative level designs could be worked out in the expert workshop with livestock scientists. It should be examined whether changes in the criteria could be agreed upon in a different setting, including on-site meetings, more time, and more detailed ""playing"" with the data. Ultimately, examining a ""given"" set of criteria in more extensive negotiation processes with various stakeholders and using economic impact assessments to analyse the exceptional extent of criteria adjustments seems reasonable. For further systematic optimisation, it would be necessary to investigate how individual or bundled measures affect animal welfare. There is room here for other research efforts, which could be carried out based on already established animal welfare programs. German dairy production is characterised by great heterogeneity in farm structures. The results of this thesis provide an overview of the expected reactions and costs of the required farm adaptations to meet the criteria of the cattle working group in the study region of northwest Germany. Still, they cannot be easily transferred to other production regions. Although this thesis provides transferable initial indications, it would be advisable to transfer this study’s approach to other study regions for an all-encompassing picture.

Data from: N2 and N2O mitigation potential of replacing maize with the perennial biomass crop Silphium perfoliatum – An incubation study

Abstract:
Sustainability of biogas production is strongly dependent on soil-borne greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during feedstock cultivation. Maize (Zea mays) is the most common feedstock for biogas production in Europe. Since it is an annual crop requiring high fertilizer input, maize cropping can cause high GHG emissions on sites that, due to their hydrology, have high N2O emission potential. On such sites, cultivation of cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum) as a perennial crop could be a more environmentally-friendly alternative offering versatile ecosystem services. To evaluate the possible benefits of perennial cup-plant cropping on GHG emissions and nitrogen losses, an incubation study was conducted with intact soil cores from a maize field and a cup plant field. The 15N gas flux method was used to quantify N source-specific N2 and N2O fluxes. Cumulated N2O emissions and N2+N2O emissions did not differ significantly between maize and cup plant soils, but tended to be higher in maize soil. Soils from both systems exhibited relatively high and similar N2O/(N2+N2O) ratios (N2Oi). N2O emissions originating from sources other than the 15N-labelled NO3 pool were low, but were the only fluxes exhibiting a significant difference between the maize and cup plant soils. Missing differences in fluxes derived from the 15N-pool indicate that under the experimental conditions with high moisture and NO3- level, and without plants, the cropping system had little effect on N fluxes related to denitrification. Lower soil pH and higher bulk density in the cup plant soil are likely to have reduced the mitigation potential of perennial biomass cropping.

Self-incompatibility (S) genotypes of cultivated sweet cherries – An overview 2023-Update

Abstract:
A gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) system determines fertility in sweet cherries and prevents pollination with own and genetically related pollen. This mechanism is controlled by a multi-allelic S locus coding for two genes involved in fertilization: the S allele-specific ribonuclease (S RNase) expressed in the female style and the S specific F-box protein (SFB) in the male pollen. Knowledge about the S genotype of sweet cherries is very important for cherry growers and breeders. Molecular markers have been developed to distinguish the S alleles in sweet cherries. In this new update from February 2023, a total of 72 incompatibility groups in 1700 sweet cherry cultivars have been listed. Twenty-six sweet cherry cultivars have a unique combination of S alleles, were described as universal donors and were categorized in the incompatibility group 0. Additionally, there exist 91 self-compatible (SC) sweet cherry genotypes belonging to the group SC. A total of 26 different S alleles were described in the cultivated sweet cherries up to date. These are the S alleles S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S9, S10, S12, S13, S14, S16, S17, S18, S19, S21, S22, S24, S27, S30, S37 and S38 (S7m), and the three mutated, non-functional S alleles S3', S4', S5'. This work summarizes all available data on S allele genotyping for in cultivated sweet cherries. Table 1 describes the S genotypes of all sweet cherries studied. It also contains information about the parentage, if known. Table 2 gives an overview about of all the defined incompatibility groups. The groups are sorted according to their group numbers or the S allele numbers, respectively. Table 3 lists all genotypes of the incompatibility group 0, which exhibit a unique S genotype. Table 4 includes all known self-compatible sweet cherry genotypes of the group SC. All published data used to describe of the S genotypes are listed in the file named 'References'. For S genotyping of sweet cherries, we have established a reference assortment including sweet cherry accessions for a large scale of S alleles (Table 5). These reference genotypes were planted in the orchard of the Julius Kühn-Institut in Dresden-Pillnitz.The present dataset will be regularly updated and improved with all new S alleles data of sweet cherries. In addition, all new information about the parentage is very important for breeding research.

Steckbriefe zu humuserhaltenden und -mehrenden Maßnahmen auf Ackerflächen: Projektbericht des Thünen-Instituts im HumusKlimaNetz

Abstract:
In der deutschen und europäischen Klimapolitik hat der Humusaufbau und -erhalt in den letzten Jahren immer mehr an Bedeutung gewonnen. In diesem Kontext sollen in dem HumusKlimaNetz Maßnahmen zum Humusaufbau in der Praxis erprobt werden. Um den beteiligten Betrieben mögliche Maßnahmen zur Umsetzung anbieten zu können, ist es entscheidend zu bewerten, welche Maßnahmen wie stark zum Humuserhalt und -aufbau beitragen können und welche sonstigen ackerbaulichen Effekte bzw. Umweltwirkungen die Maßnahmen mit sich bringen. Für den ggf. erforderlichen Kompensationsbedarf ist es notwendig, die Kosten die mit der Umsetzung der Maßnahmen verbunden sind, zu kennen. In diesem Bericht werden die wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse zu den genannten Fragen zusammengetragen und auf Basis der Ertragsstatistik regionsspezifische Pauschalen für eine Kompensation von Maßnahmen entwickelt. Somit ist der Projektbericht eine wissenschaftliche Arbeitsgrundlage für die Förderung von Humusmaßnahmen im Rahmen des Modell- und Demonstrationsvorhabens „HumusKlimaNetz“.

Workshop on the evaluation of NEA mackerel stock components (WKEVALMAC, outputs from 2023 meeting)

Abstract:
The objective of WKEVALMAC was to review information on stock identification of NEA Mackerel and develop a consensus understanding of the Atlantic mackerel population structure and key uncertainties. The data and studies covered the distribution and movements of different life-stages of mackerel, including changes over time. The evaluated data and studies centred on genetics, tagging, otolith approaches; egg and larval dispersal models; commercial landings and perceptions from the industry. The motivation was the continued consideration of the mackerel stock consisting of three ‘components’ and the advice sheet referring to separate recommendations for at least one of the ‘components’ (the North Sea). The workshop found that spatial and temporal patterns in demography (e.g. size and age) of NEA mackerel are not due to separate components but rather are primarily related to the highly migratory and dynamic nature of a single stock. Recent directed genetics, tagging, otolith chemistry investigations; ongoing surveys; catch data; fisher perspective; and preliminary modelling studies all failed to support the three-component concept for NEA mackerel. The Workshop therefore rejected the current three-component structure and accepted a single NEA mackerel stock concept to advance towards assessment, management, and advice. The workshop therefore recommends that the current ‘headline advice’ based on a single-stock assumption should continue and the advice sheet should discontinue reference to components within the Northeast Atlantic Mackerel stock. The workshop also raised a number of data gaps and uncertainties which can be addressed with future research. These included: improvements to existing survey and catch data programs to enhance our understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of the NEA stock, investigations in to how indeterminant spawning interacts with migration behaviours in the annual egg production estimates, and exploring assessment model sensitivity to parameter values and model configuration given the non-stationarity in this stock.

Bestockte Holzbodenkarte 2018

Abstract:
Als Grundlage für das fernerkundungsbasierte Monitoring von Waldökosystemen muss die zu betrachtende Waldfläche eingegrenzt werden. Zu diesem Zweck wird in der Regel eine Wald- oder Holzbodenkarte hergestellt, welche auf einer Walddefinition basiert. Die hier vorgestellte bestockte Holzbodenkarte wurde auf Basis der Walddefinition der Bundeswaldinventur produziert (https://www.bundeswaldinventur.de/service/fachbegriffe-und-abkuerzungen). Ziel der Karte ist die Erfassung der mit Forstpflanzen bestocken Waldfläche. Dabei werden Landnutzungs- und Landbedeckungseigenschaften berücksichtigt, zum Beispiel gehören Weihnachtsbaumkulturen, Stadtparks oder Gehölzstreifen nach dem Bundeswaldgesetzt nicht zur Waldfläche und werden nicht erfasst. Die Karte basiert auf den Klassen AX_Wald, AX_Sumpf, AX_Moor des Basis-DLM 2018 (https://gdz.bkg.bund.de/index.php/default/digitales-basis-landschaftsmodell-ebenen-basis-dlm-ebenen.html), sowie den Produkten High Resolution Layer Tree Cover Density 2015/2018 (https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/high-resolution-layers/forests/tree-cover-density/status-maps/tree-cover-density-2018?tab=metadata) und Feature Additional Support Layer 2018 (https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/forest-2018-user-manual.pdf). Flächen mit einem Überschirmungsgrad ≤ 50% und Gebiete mit einer Minimalen Flächeneinheit (MMU) ≤ 0,25 Hektar werden von der Holzbodenkarte nicht berücksichtigt. Die Genauigkeit der Karte wurde nach Stehman (2014, doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2014.930207) basierend auf den Waldentscheiden der Kohlenstoffinventur 2017/2018 geschätzt. Dabei erreicht die Karte eine Gesamtgenauigkeit von 96,49 ± 0,05%, ein Produzentengenauigkeit für Wald von 94,06 ± 0,12% und eine Nutzergenauigkeit für Wald von 94,56 ± 0,11%. Die deutschlandweite bestockte Holzbodenfläche umfasst 10.962.638,95 Hektar. Damit liegt die kartierte Fläche 0,45% (97.80,91 Hektar) unter der bestockten Holbodenfläche nach BWI3 (https://bwi.info/).

Data from: The draft chromosome-level genome assembly of tetraploid ground cherry (Prunus fruticosa Pall.) from long reads

Abstract:
Cherries are among the most popular fruits among consumers and are grown for industrial processing or fresh consumption. The cultivation and breeding of cherries faces new challenges in the future, not least due to climate change. Cultivation is becoming increasingly difficult due to changing climatic conditions, diseases and pests. Therefore, the market demands new varieties with high fruit quality and adaptation to locally changing conditions. Breeding for tree fruit is a long-term task, though, and tools to facilitate this process are unfortunately not yet available to a sufficient extent. Rapid progress in third-generation sequencing technologies enables breeders to explore and exploit the genomic information underlying economical important traits. We used Oxford Nanopore Technology PromethION platform and R10.3 pore type to sequence the genome of tetraploid ground cherry (Prunus fruticosa). The final sequence has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession JAHHUK000000000. A specific description of the work can be viewed at https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.01.446499v1. The version described in this paper is version JAHHUK010000000.
 The data on this platform includes 17 files, supports the assembling and annotation procedure, and provides insights into this challenging work. 
 As a result, five assemblies (MiniasmMinimap.fasta, medaka.fasta, raconpolished.fasta, purged.fasta, purged2.fasta) have been processed to generate a draft genome assembly. 
 The final genome sequence was masked (genome.fa.masked.gz, genome.fa.out, genome.fa.tbl) and annotated using Braker 1 and Braker 2, GeMoMa pipeline and eight reference datasets from other Prunus species. 
 The final structural annotation, coding sequences and protein predictions are provided for future studies (GeMoMa_Annotation_filtered_predictions_8ref_RNAseq_Braker.gff, GeMoMa_Annotation_filtered_predictions_8ref_RNAseq_Braker_assignment.tabular, GeMoMa_Annotation_filtered_predictions_8ref_RNAseq_Braker_cds-parts.fasta, GeMoMa_Annotation_filtered_predictions_8ref_RNAseq_Braker_proteins.fasta). 
 The functional prediction was performed with InterProScan (Results IPS.xlsx). 
 In addition, the sequences and annotation of the chloroplast (Pf_chloroplast_1.0.fasta, GeSeqJob-20210201-124142_utg000088l_segment0_1_GFF3.gff3) and mitochondrion (Pf_mitochondria_1.0, GeSeqJob-20210202-114557_utg001396l_trimmed_GFF3.gff3) are presented.

Data: Nematode-based indices in soil ecology - application, utility and future directions

Abstract:
The underlying data sets contain references from a literature survey that was undertaken using the Web of Science Core Collection database. The data set (Du_Perez_etal_2021_references.ris) contains all references (672) that were used to create the figures in the corresponding paper with the focus on nematode-based bioindicators (NBIs). The data set (Du_Perez_et_al_2021.xlsx) contains all references added by information about NBIs, location information, spatial scale, land use, land cover and study focus which are explained below. We identified three scientific papers, namely Bongers (1990), Ferris et al. (2001), and Ferris (2010), that serve as the foundation and main reference works for scientists and researchers that report on the application of NBIs. In total, 11 NBIs were used in these studies, namely Maturity Index, Maturity Index 2-5, Plant-parasitic Index, Sigma maturity index, Colonizer-Persister (CP) -Triangle, Enrichment Index, Structure Index, Basal Index, Channel Index, Food Web Analysis, and Metabolic footprints. Using the Cited Reference Search tool, a search was conducted for works (up until the end of 2020; last search performed 31 March 2021) that cited each of the above-mentioned scientific papers. This returned 1 113, 653, and 122 citations, respectively, for the Bongers (1990), Ferris et al. (2001), and Ferris (2010) papers. The results were combined, duplicates removed, and further refined to include only peer-reviewed scientific articles. Furthermore, all marine and freshwater studies were excluded. Finally, a total of 1199 papers was included in the analyses.
 The next step was to screen each paper to assess whether it met the following basic criteria: 1) empirical study (therefore not a review or meta-analysis), 2) application of at least one NBI, and 3) focused on terrestrial habitat(s). A total of 672 scientific papers met these criteria and, from them, the following information was extracted and recorded: i) which NBIs were applied, ii) location information and spatial scale of the study site(s), iii) study focus, and iv) land use and land cover information.
 The study foci were identified based on the knowledge and experience of the authors. The land use and land cover criteria, in turn, were based on SEEA (2012), which defines land use as ‘the activities undertaken and the institutional arrangements put in place for a given area for the purposes of economic production, or the maintenance and restoration of environmental functions’. Land use therefore classifies all areas under human management according to its use into five categories namely: ‘forestry’, ‘not in use’, ‘agriculture’, ‘built-up and related’, and ‘maintenance and restoration’ . Land cover, in turn, is defined by  as ‘the observed physical and biological cover of the Earth’s surface and includes natural vegetation and abiotic (non-living) surfaces’. Six land cover categories were recognized, namely ‘sparse’, ‘grassland’, ‘tree-covered’, ‘shrub-covered’, ‘herbaceous crops’, and ‘woody and multi crop’. The ‘sparse’ category represents both barren terrestrial land and sparsely vegetated land. Further information on each land use and land cover category is provided in the section 3.3. The above mentioned references are as follows: Bongers, T., 1990. The maturity index: an ecological measure of environmental disturbance based on nematode species composition.

Calculations of gaseous and particulate emissions from German agriculture 1990 - 2020: Input data and emission results

Abstract:
In international conventions Germany has committed to the mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution. These international regulations (protocols etc.) are the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP), and within the European Union the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants (NEC Directive). These conventions require annual calculations of the emissions of the respective gases and air pollutants. The results have to be documented in an emission inventory and to be reported to the organisations in charge. The data file contains input data and results of the calculation of gas and particulate emissions from German agriculture for Germany and the federal states in the years 1990 - 2020. In this context the sector Agriculture comprises the emissions from animal husbandry, the use of agricultural soils and anaerobic digestion of energy crops. As required by the guidelines, emissions from activities preceding agriculture, from the use of energy and from land use change are reported elsewhere in the national inventories.

Dataset to: Greenhouse gas emissions from Silphium perfoliatum and silage maize cropping on stagnosols

Abstract:
To achieve the desired greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation from bioenergy, emissions from feedstock production need to be low. These emissions mainly consist of direct soil-borne GHG emissions during feedstock cultivation and indirect emissions from land use change caused by the competition between first-generation biomass and food production. Marginal land, such as low mountain ranges, is particularly suitable for feedstock production due to the small impact on indirect land-use change. However, the most common biomass crop in Europe, maize (Zea mays L.), does not achieve its full yield potential in cold, wet conditions. On such sites, cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.) could serve as an alternative to maize. As a perennial, cup plant provides soil protective benefits and many more versatile ecosystem services. To evaluate whether cup plant also provides nitrous oxide mitigation potential, a two-year field experiment was conducted to compare GHG emissions from cup plant and maize fields. GHG emissions were quantified using the closed chamber technique. Cup plant fields emitted on average 3.6±4.3 kg N2O-N ha-1 a-1 (-85%) less than maize fields. This corresponded to 74.0±94.1 g CO2-eq kWh-1 (-78%) less emissions per produced electrical power. However, the area (-34%) and nitrogen (-32%) productivity of cup plant were significantly lower than of maize. Hence, cup plant as a feedstock reduces direct field-derived GHG emissions compared with maize but, due to lower yields cup plant increases the risk of associated emissions from land-use change. Therefore, the increased sustainability of bioenergy from biogas by replacing maize with cup plant is heavily dependent on the performance of maize at these sites and on the ecosystem services of cup plant in addition to GHG savings.

PhenoApp Input/Output files

Abstract:
With the ongoing cost decrease of genotyping and sequencing technologies, accurate and fast phenotyping remains the bottleneck in the utilizing of plant genetic resources for breeding and breeding research. Although cost-efficient high-throughput phenotyping platforms emerged during the last decades for specific traits and/or species, manual phenotyping is still predominant and a time- and money-consuming task. Approaches that improve data recording, processing or handling are pivotal steps towards an efficient usage of genetic resources and demanded by the research community. Therefore, we developed PhenoApp, an open source Android app for tablets and smartphones to facilitate the digital recording of phenotypical data in the field and greenhouse. It is a versatile tool, that offers the possibility to fully customize own descriptors/scales for any possible scenario or the usage of pre-integrated ready-to-use BBCH scales for apple, cereals, grapevine, maize, potato, rapeseed and rice. Additional BBCH scales can easily be added. Furthermore, the simple and adaptable structure of input and output files enables an easy data handling by either spreadsheet software or even the integration in the workflow of laboratory information management systems (LIMS). The embedding in international information standards such as MIAPPE or the implementation regarding FAIR data principles is feasible. PhenoApp is a decisive contribution to increase efficiency of digital data acquisition in breeding, breeding research and genebank management by accelerating the labor intensive and time-consuming acquisition of phenotyping data.

Workshop on the development of a spatial database and model for eels (WKSMEEL)

Abstract:
WKSMEEL is part of the roadmap defined by the WKFEA (Workshop on the future of eel advice). Experts from Japan, USA, Canada and Europe met to discuss modelling methods and the data necessary to support the development of a spatial assessment of the stock of European eel (Anguilla anguilla). Modelling of the European eel stock is envisioned as a two-level modelling process. At the regional level, it requires the implementation of statistical extrapolation models in freshwater habitats and specific models in lakes or lagoons. At the whole-stock level, a stage-based spatial model is envisioned. The rationale for choosing a stage-based approach for the global models and the requirements and validation of different regional models are discussed. The data requirements for both regional and global stock models have been reviewed with a specific focus on spatial data. For the regional models, a common GIS data structure using broad scale river networks or national databases is proposed. This database should contain both water surface (lake, lagoons, transitional waters) and rivers. A database structure to store information on eel habitat, dam and electrofishing is proposed. The availability of GIS river database, dam data and electrofishing data is assessed at the European level, using survey questionnaires sent to national correspondents. For the global stock model, the data requirement, including the output of the regional models, have been defined.

Microsatellite/SSR dataset: pomological and molecular characterization of apple cultivars (Malus × domestica Borkh.) of the German Fruit Genebank

Abstract:
The German Fruit Genebank (https://www.deutsche-genbank-obst.de/) is a decentralized network with focus on the coordination of the different germplasm collections in Germany to conserve and utilize genetic resources of native fruit species. Here, emphasis is put on the trueness-to-type of the genetic resources based on pomological and molecular characteristics. Over the years from 2009 to 2021, several projects were carried out to take an inventory of the germplasm collections in the apple (Malus ×domestica) network of the German Fruit Genebank. In a first step, at least two knowledgeable experts of the German Pomological Association characterized accessions pomologically. In a second step, a DNA fingerprint analysis was used for the molecular characterization. The DNA fingerprint analysis utilized a set of 17 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and 8 reference genotypes recommended by the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources (ECPGR; http://www.ecpgr.cgiar.org/) Malus/Pyrus working group and was performed by Microsynth ecogenics GmbH (Balgach, Switzerland). 8,184 samples (fruits/ leaves) of apple trees belonging to the German Fruit Genebank from eight network collections were investigated. 1,404 different fingerprints in correspondence to cultivars could be estimated for apple.

Temporal trends of mercury levels in fish (dab, Limanda limanda) and sediment from the German Bight (North Sea) in the period 1995–2020

Abstract:
As a toxic and harmful global pollutant, mercury (Hg) enters the marine environment through natural sources, and human activities. It bioaccumulates through the food chain and therefore, Hg is of great importance for environmental monitoring. This study aims to answer the question if Hg contamination in fish and sediment from the German Bight follows temporal trends. Therefore, 496 individual female dab (Limanda limanda) were analyzed. The Hg concentrations in the muscle of dab from the German Bight showed significant increase in function of time with an annual percental change of 1.4%, leading to a 41% increase in Hg contamination level within 25 years of monitoring. At the same time, Hg concentrations in sediment—analyzed in 86 samples—significantly decreased in the nearby North Sea environment. This surprising contradiction is shown in the present study and possible causes are discussed. It could be clearly shown that contamination in sediment and biota can follow completely different time courses and therefore, different environmental matrices should be considered in future monitoring studies. Age of the fish turned out to be a biological factor of particular importance for temporal trend analysis. Methode Mercury in fish The determination of Hg in fish from 1995 to 2009 followed the protocol described by Harms (1981, 1998). Briefly, wet samples were subjected to a pressure digestion by nitric acid in PTFE tubes heated up to 135 °C for 2 h. This was partly supported by a microwave system, “MLS-Ethos-plus” (MLS Mikrowellen Labor-Systeme GmbH, Leutkirch, Germany). Mercury was determined by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry using a flow injection mercury system Model 420 (Perkin Elmer, Rodgau, Germany) with background compensation and Hg lamp. A clean bench was used to avoid contamination during sample processing. The limit of detection (LD) was calculated according to DIN 32,645 (DIN, 1994) and was always below 1.2 μg Hg/kg wet weight (ww). The method used from 2010 to determine Hg in fish is in detail described in Kammann et al. (2021). Briefly, samples were freeze-dried using a lyophilizer (LD 1–2,Christ, Osterode, Germany) and subsequently homogenized using an agate mortar or an ultra Turrax tube drive dispenser (IKA, Staufen, Germany) to obtain a dry and homogenous sample powder. Total Hg was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using a Direct Mercury Analyzer (DMA-80, MLS, Leutkirch, Germany). A total of 20–30 mg of each sample were weighted into the boat containers of the DMA-80. Direct analysis for total Hg content was performed using a 10-level calibration with standards in 0.5 M nitric acid. The LD and the limit of quantification (LQ) were calculated from a standard curve according to DIN 32,645 (DIN, 1994) with a confidence level of 99%. Considering the sample preparation, a LD of 0.080 μg/kg ww and a LQ of 0.230 μg/kg ww were determined for Hg. No values below these limits were found in any sample under investigation. Preparation steps were carried out under clean benches all the time. Clean lab conditions of ISO class 7 were available since 2018. Nitric acid (69%, ultrapure quality) and certified standard solutions of Hg were purchased from Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany, in 0.5 M nitric acid. Ultrapure water was obtained from a Purelab Flex 3 device (Elga Veolia; High Wycombe, UK). The accuracy of the Hg measurement in fish was determined by analysis of Certified Reference Materials (e.g., DORM-4) obtained from the National Research Council (NRC) in Canada which was taken through the same analytical procedure as the samples. All samples were measured in triplicates. External quality assurance was done by participation in laboratory proficiency tests conducted by QUASIMEME (www.wepal.nl) designed for marine environment analytics from 1997 to 2021. Results of 55 QUASIMEME intercalibrations are presented in Table S1 with a mean z-score of 0.09 and only 7% of unsatisfying results (z-score >  = │2.5│).

Data set: Comparison of two different experimental environments for resistance screenings for leafhopper-transmitted wheat dwarf virus in wheat

Abstract:
Wheat dwarf virus is an important pathogen in wheat and other cereals. Evaluation of tolerant/resistant genotypes was previously based on inoculation with virus-bearing leafhoppers and subsequent phenotyping in gauze houses under semi-field conditions. Within an improved procedure, plants are inoculated in the greenhouse under an infection hood and subsequently planted out in gauze houses. To compare the two methods, temperature profiles were established for both variants (2- Temperature profile) and the optimal inoculation time for inoculation under an infection hood in the greenhouse was determined (3-Inoculation time). In addition, a test panel of 80 genotypes (1-plant material) was phenotyped for both variants for germination rate (4-Germination rate), infection status, symptom score and relative virus titer (5- Gauze house, 6-Inoculation hood). The methods used to generate the data are described within Pfrieme, A.K. et al.: Comparison of two different experimental environments for resistance screenings for leafhopper-transmitted wheat dwarf virus in wheat.

Dataset from the evaluation of resistance/susceptibility of Malus genetic resources to apple blotch disease (Diplocarpon coronariae)

Abstract:
The dataset contains the field evaluation data and data from two artificial inoculation experiments for the evaluation of Malus genetic resources for apple blotch disease. Apple blotch, caused by the fungus, Diplocarpon coronariae, is an economically important disease in organic apple production in Europe. The disease, which occurs worldwide, was first described on leaves of Malus coronaria in Wisconsin, USA. Symptoms of apple blotch are black spots on apple leaves followed by leaf chlorosis and finally severe defoliation before fruit harvest. This weakens the physiological condition of the host, resulting in long-term reduced tree vigour and decreased yields. Currently, apple blotch appears in apple-growing regions in South Germany, Switzerland, Southern Austria and Northern Italy. The only effective method to control the disease is the application of fungicides, which is restricted in organic production. Cultivation of apple blotch-resistant cultivars is a desirable strategy to control the disease but little is known about the resistance of Malus genetic resources. 
 We evaluated the Malus wild species accessions of the gene bank collection from the Julius Kühn-Institut for field incidence of apple blotch (Occurence of D. coronariae JKI 2014_15_16_18.csv) and leaf fall (Leaf fall wild species JKI 2015_16_18.csv) over a time period of four years. To confirm the field observations, only leaves of accessions without symptoms were tested by artificial inoculation with spores of D. coronariae in a laboratory assay. The necrotic leaf area was measured 14 days post inoculation (dpi) using the leaf doctor application (Artificial inoculation D. coronariae_wild species.csv). Most of the evaluated cultivars were susceptible and developed symptoms after inoculation with D. coronariae. Information about the resistance/susceptibility of Malus genetic resources to apple blotch is still insufficient. The data obtained will provide insight into potential resistance donors, which can be used in future breeding programs.

Durchschnittliche bevölkerungsgewichtete Wegezeit in den Untersuchungslandkreisen und ausgewählten kreiseigenen Gemeinden, differenziert nach Verkehrsträgern, in Minuten

Abstract:
Oft wird angenommen, dass ländliche Räume über Wohnraum verfügen, um Geflüchtete dezentral unterzubringen. In Abhängigkeit vom konkreten Wohnort kann es aber sein, dass dort wichtige Infrastrukturen nur schwer erreicht werden können, was negative Auswirkungen auf die Teilhabechancen der Betroffenen haben kann. Daher haben wir für die Projektregionen die Erreichbarkeit ausgewählter Infrastrukturen mittels verschiedener Verkehrsträger mit dem Thünen-Erreichbarkeitsmodell analysiert. Um die globale Erreichbarkeitssituation in den einzelnen Projektregionen abzuschätzen, haben wir die Erreichbarkeit folgender Infrastrukturen zu einem Index „mittlere bevölkerungsgewichtete Erreichbarkeit“ zusammengefasst: Öffentliche Apotheken, Hausarzt, Kinderarzt, Zahnarzt, Krankenhaus, Supermärkte und Discounter, Kindergarten, allgemeinbildende Schulen (Grundschule, Schulen mit Sekundarstufe I, und II), Unterzentrum, Mittel- und Oberzentrum, Haltestelle des öffentlichen Verkehrs (ÖPNV). Das Ergebnis ist in der Tabelle dargestellt. Es lässt sich erkennen, dass es sowohl zwischen den Untersuchungslandkreisen als auch den Untersuchungsgemeinden nur wenige nennenswerte Erreichbarkeitsunterschiede innerhalb einer Verkehrsmittelkategorie gibt. Die besten Erreichbarkeiten ergeben sich für Bürger*innen, die einen Pkw nutzen können, gefolgt von denjenigen, die den ÖPNV nutzen können. Die Ergebnisse für die restlichen im Projekt untersuchten Infrastrukturen können im Thünen Working Paper 122 (Neumeier 2019) eingesehen werden, auf das über folgenden Link zugegriffen werden kann: https://literatur.thuenen.de/digbib_extern/dn061014.pdf

Dataset: Identification and validation of QTL for WDV (Wheat dwarf virus) resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum) Version 1

Abstract:
In this version one we added a description for chromosome numbers in the readme sheet of the xlsx-file. In addition, a correction of the the unit in the column ‘position’ of 3-Genotypic data was made. Wheat dwarf virus (WDV) causes high yield losses in wheat and other cereals. To date, there is little known about WDV resistant/tolerant varieties and no known information about genomic regions responsible for resistance is available. To identify the relevant genes, a panel of 500 wheat accessions (1-Plant material) was phenotyped after artificial inoculation in gauze houses for virus titer, infection rate, plant height, and yield parameters compared to healthy controls (2-Phenotypic data). In addition, 85 T. aestivum - Ae. tauschii introgression lines, containing different chromosome segments of Ae. tauschii, were tested via greenhouse inoculation tests. Accessions with low susceptibility to WDV were found in domesticated wheats and wild relatives. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of a subpanel comprising 250 hexaploid wheat cultivars genotyped with the 15k iSelect chip (3-Genotypic data) identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for partial resistance. To validate the QTL, biparental SSD (Single Seed Descent) and DH (Double-Haploid) populations were screened for WDV resistance and genotyped using the 25k iSelect SNP chip (5-Phenotypic and genotypic data of biparental populations).

Dataset for a systematic literature review on drivers of forest area development

Abstract:
The table contains data extracted from a systematic literature review. The aim of the systematic analysis is to identify patterns in drivers of forest area development. The systematic analysis was conducted using the RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses in environmental research (ROSES) method. This approach involves the search for literature in two databases (Web of Science and Scopus) using a clearly defined search string and the screening for literature based on a predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria within the author team. A comprehensive protocol and method description can be found in the evidence and gap map published by Tandetzki et. al. (2022)[1]. The method introduced in Tandetzki et al. (2022) is utilized and updated, including the search for articles which was renewed and now includes publications up to August 2022. After screening the articles, a well-defined study selection was made following a pre-defined and standardized process. In this process, a distinction is made between basic studies, which take into account only a few basic drivers of forest area development, and advanced studies, which assess the significant influence of multiple drivers on forest area development. Finally, the selection includes 85 studies, out of which 14 are considered as basic studies. In the dataset presented here, all included studies, their extracted data (e.g., datasets, data source, estimation methods, and studies periods), the study design, as well as the drivers of forest area development in form of independent variables (the latter are coded with numbers indicating the type of influence on the significance level).

Item characteristics of marine litter at the seafloor of the Baltic Sea

Abstract:
Plastic litter items (LI) at the seafloor of the Baltic Sea comprises different polymers. 40 LI were collected within fishery catches by bottom trawling during three cruises in 2020 and 2021 and analysed for their polymer types using attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, performed on a Spotlight 400 FTIR Imaging System (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, USA). The resulting spectra were compared against reference spectra databases. Just LI spectra showing correlation factors above 0.90 compared to the reference spectra were included in the evaluation. Polymer type of plastic LI under investigation could be attributed to six different polymer groups: Polyethylene (PE), polyamide (PA), polypropylene (PP), polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyester (PES) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PE was the most frequently identified polymer representing 59% of all plastic items under investigation - followed by PA (17%), PP (12%), PVC (7%) and PES (3%).

Microsatellite marker data of Patellifolia patellaris, P. procumbens and P. webbiana

Abstract:
Microsatellite primers were developed to promote studies on the patterns of genetic diversity within Patellifolia patellaris and the relationship between the three species of the genus Patellifolia. The genomic sequence from Patellifolia procumbens was screened for SSRs and 3648 SSRs were identified. A subset of 53 SSR markers was validated of which 25 proved to be polymorphic in the three species except for the P. webbiana-specific marker JKIPat16. A detailed description of the marker including GenBank accession numbers was published by Nachtigall et al. (2016) Applications in Plant Sciences 4(8):1600040 (DOI: 10.3732/apps.1600040). The SSR markers were applied to study the genetic differentiation between P. patellaris as well as P. procumbens/P. webbiana occurrences sampled on the Iberian Peninsula, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the Cape Verde Islands (Frese et al., 2017, Euphytica 213:187 (DOI: 10.1007/s10681-017-1942-0), Frese et al., 2018 accepted).
 The marker set was used to study genetic diversity and genetic differentiation within the species. SSR data presented in excel file were generated by JKI in Quedlinburg, Germany. P. patellaris plants were sampled at 26 localities in 2015, analysed using 24 SSR markers, the raw data were binned and statistically analysed in 2016-2017. The first data sheet contains information on 581 plants in total.

Data set: blank values from heubach dustmeter-testing sugar beets

Abstract:
With the Heubach method free floating dust of treated seeds can be measured. The Heubach value is used as an indicator for seed quality. One way to make the heubach results more reliable can be the definition of LOD and LOQ. Blank measurements were conducted in several heubach labs for this data collection to allow a calculation of LOD (limit of detection) and LOQ (limit of quantification) for the Heubach method. Three Tests (Data_LOD_LOQ_ZR.xlsx) were performed following the EU-Code of Practise for the monitoring of floating dust of treated seeds (Version 05.1, published by the Seed Treatment Stewardship Steering Committee (STICCS Group) on 1st August 2021). The material and methods used are described in Material_and_Method.pdf and the procedure for estimation of LOD and LOQ for Heubach seed abrasion dust method is described in Procedure_for_the_estimation_of_LOD_and_LOQ_sugar_beets.pdf.

Ausgestaltung der Ökoregelungen in Deutschland - Stellungnahmen für das BMEL : Band 4 - Zweite Schätzung des Budgetbedarfes auf Basis der im GAPDZG festgelegten Ökoregelungen in Abhängigkeit von verschiedenen Optionen zur Ausgestaltung

Abstract:
Mit der gegenwärtigen Reform der Gemeinsamen Agrarpolitik (GAP) verfolgt die EU insbesondere das Ziel, neben der Einkommensstützung den Beitrag des Agrarsektors zum Schutz des Klimas, der Umwelt und der biologischen Vielfalt zu erhöhen. Hierfür wird in der neuen GAP ab 01.01.2023 in der 1. Säule die Basisprämie an die Einhaltung der „erweiterten Konditionalität“ gebunden und es werden Ökoregelungen eingeführt. Für die freiwillige Teilnahme an den Ökoregelungen erhalten die Landwirte eine zusätzliche Förderung. Weiterhin möchte die EU die Agrarpolitik flexibler gestalten und stärker an den Bedürfnissen der jeweiligen Mitgliedstaaten ausrichten. Hierfür müssen die Mitgliedstaaten nationale GAP-Strategiepläne entwickeln und darin die Ausgestaltung der Ökoregelungen festlegen. Der nationale Strategieplan mit den Umsetzungsvorschlägen für Ökoregelungen wird federführend vom BMEL in Abstimmung mit den Ländern und Interessensvertretern entwickelt. Im Rahmen der vorbereitenden Arbeiten am GAP-Strategieplan-Entwurf für Deutschland wurde das Thünen-Institut beauftragt, die ökonomischen Implikationen der Ökoregelungen abzuschätzen. Dazu gehören neben der Frage der einzelbetrieblichen Umsetzungskosten vor allem Analysen zur erwarteten Inanspruchnahme und Budgetwirksamkeit der Maßnahmen bei unterschiedlichen Prämienhöhen. Für die Bewertung der ökologischen Wirksamkeit der vorgeschlagenen Ökoregelungen wurden Beiträge aus dem Konsortium abgerufen, das unter Federführung des Instituts für Ländliche Strukturforschung (IflS) mit der Ex-ante-Evaluierung des GAP-Strategieplan-Entwurfs beauftragt ist. Die Ex-ante-Evaluierung wurde dabei als begleitender und unterstützender Prozess der Planentwicklung verstanden. Der Gegenstand der Bewertung leitet sich aus den in Art. 6 Nr. 1 Buchstaben d), e) und f) der GAP-Strategieplan-Verordnung dargelegten spezifischen Zielen ab. Zusätzlich werden Fragen der Wirksamkeit, Effizienz und Konsistenz im Kontext der gesamten Grünen Architektur angerissen. Der vorliegenden Band 4 des Thünen Working Papers 180 analysiert die Auswirkungen verschiedener Varianten zur Ausgestaltung und Prämienhöhe der geplanten Ökoregelungen auf die erwartete Inanspruchnahme und den Mittelbedarf. Dazu werden Szenarien mit unterschiedlicher Prämienhöhe für die Ökoregelung „Vielfältige Kulturen im Ackerbau“ in Kombination mit Varianten zur Anrechnung von Brachflächen als Kultur betrachtet. Ferner wird der Einfluss einzelner Annahmen zur Akzeptanz weiterer Ökoregelungen auf den Mittelbedarf untersucht. Diskutiert werden zudem weitere wichtige Einflussfaktoren und Unsicherheitsfaktoren, die die Akzeptanz einzelner Ökoregelungen beeinflussen.

Abstract:
The data provide an overview of the research on the interaction of the fluorescent dye pyranine with the collectors: Tyvek, paper patches, plastic foil, labels, nylon filters, fiberglass filters and petri dishes. A number of sheets with data on blank value, recovery rate, storability, and UV radiation are included in the Excel file. For each collector, the blank value was examined three times. When measuring the recovery rate, different collectors use different numbers of repeats. Here, between 5 and 50 repeats were used. Data on the recovery rate for all collectors during various time periods is presented on the sheet of storability. The collectors have different target concentrations, storage times, and repeat numbers. The final sheet shows the raw data used for the analysis of the UV-degradation of every collector. For 15 to 30 minutes, all collectors were exposed to UV radiation. For each collector, the number of repetitions was the same.

Thünen-Baseline 2024 - 2034: Agrarökonomische Projektionen für Deutschland

Abstract:
Dieser Bericht stellt ausgewählte Ergebnisse der Thünen-Baseline 2024-2034 sowie die zugrunde liegenden Annahmen dar. Die Thünen-Baseline ist ein Basisszenario und beschreibt die zukünftige Entwicklung der Agrarmärkte unter definierten politischen und wirtschaftlichen Rahmenbedingungen. Zentrale Annahmen sind die Beibehaltung der derzeitigen Agrarpolitik und Umsetzung bereits beschlossener Politik-änderungen sowie die Fortschreibung exogener Einflussfaktoren auf Basis historischer Trends. Die Berechnungen beruhen auf Daten und Informationen, die bis zum Frühjahr 2024 vorlagen. Dargestellt werden Projektionsergebnisse für Agrarhandel, Preise, Nachfrage, Produktion, Einkommen und Umweltwirkungen. Die Darstellung der Ergebnisse konzentriert sich hauptsächlich auf die Entwicklungen des deutschen Agrarsektors bis zum Jahr 2034 im Vergleich zum Durchschnitt der Basisperiode 2020 2022. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die EU ihre Position im weltweiten Agrarhandel bis zum Jahr 2034 behaupten kann. Die Preise für Agrarprodukte sinken zu Beginn der Projektionsperiode vom hohen Niveau des Basisjahres, können sich bis zum Jahr 2034 jedoch wieder erholen. In Deutschland entwickelt sich der Anbau von Getreide rückläufig, was auf veränderte Preiserelationen sowie einen Rückgang der landwirtschaftlich genutzten Fläche zurückzuführen ist. Im Tiersektor setzt sich der in den letzten Jahren beobachtete Abbau der Tierbestände und Rückgang der Fleischerzeugung fort, insbesondere in der Schweinehaltung, wohingegen die Geflügelfleischerzeugung bis zum Jahr 2034 noch leicht wächst. Eine positive Preisentwicklung am Milchmarkt in Verbindung mit einer weiteren Steigerung der Milchleistung führen außerdem zu einem moderaten Anstieg der Milchanlieferungen. Das durchschnittliche reale Einkommen landwirtschaftlicher Betriebe geht über die Projektionsperiode um 17 Prozent zurück und liegt damit im Jahr 2034 wieder auf dem mittleren Niveau der letzten zehn Jahre.

Dataset: Risk assessment requires several bee species to address species-specific sensitivity to insecticides at field-realistic concentrations

Abstract:
This dataset includes measurements of individual bee mortality, weight and behavior collected under laboratory conditions in six trials over two years. Individuals of seven different bee species were exposed to the plant protection product Karate® Zeon (containing the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin) at a field-realistic application rate of 0.075 L product/ha in a professional spray chamber. In addition, we applied either water as a control or dimethoate as a toxic reference to bee individuals of all species. In total, we tested 409 Apis mellifera, 385 Bombus terrestris, 383 Osmia bicornis, 139 Osmia cornuta, 140 Megachile rotundata, 105 Andrena vaga, and 103 Colletes cunicularius individuals. Bee individuals were placed into cages of 10 or 5 individuals depending on the species, and the mean individual weight of all non-Apis bees was measured as the total bee weight per cage devided by the number of bees in this cage. Bees were exposed and afterwards monitored over a period of 96 hours at pre-defined time intervals (2, 4, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after application). At each time interval, we recorded their status (dead or alive) and behavioral abnormalities (moribund, cramps, apathy, affected [including restless, vertigo, uncoordinated and dorsal position]). Further methodological and analytical details are described in the associated paper by Jütte et al.: Risk assessment requires several bee species to address species-specific sensitivity to insecticides at field-realistic concentrations. Scientific Reports, 2023. The dataset comprises four tables. Table ""Mortality"" includes a row for each individual tested with lambda-cyhalothrin (716 individuals) or water (708 individuals) stating its species identity, the number of trial and cage it was placed in, the treatment it was exposed to, its status and at which time interval this status was observed. Table ""Dimethoate"" includes a row for each individual tested with the toxic reference dimethoate (240 individuals) stating its species identity, the number of trial and cage it was placed in, its status and at which time interval this status was observed. Table ""Behavior"" includes a row for each cage that contained bee individuals treated with lambda-cyhalothrin (126 cages) or water (125 cages) at each time interval. This table states the species identity, the number of trial and cage, the treatment, the time interval, and the number of bee individuals in this cage at this time, which were dead, were alive, showed moribund behavior, showed apathy, showed cramps or showed an affected behavior, which could be any of four abnormal behaviors (restlessness, vertigo, dorsal position, uncoordinated movement). Table ""Weight"" includes a row for each cage that contained bee individuals treated with lambda-cyhalothrin (126 cages) or water (125 cages) at each time interval. This table states the species identity, the number of trial and cage, the treatment, the number of bee individuals in this cage, and the mean weight of a bee individual in this cage.

Sentinel-2 machine learning dataset for tree species classification in Germany

Abstract:
The dataset contains time series of bottom of atmosphere (BOA) reflectance from the Sentinel-2 satellite mission for tree species classification in a machine learning context. BOA reflectance was computed with the FORCE processing engine (https://force-eo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and the corresponding data cube is available at the CODE-DE (https://code-de.org/de/) or EO Lab (https://eo-lab.org/de/) platform. Alternatively, the BOA reflectance can be calculated using the provided FORCE parameter files (*.prm), guaranteeing that BOA values match the ones from the dataset. The time series were extracted from the FORCE data cube for individual tree positions as they are collected in the field by the German national forest inventory (NFI). A detailed description of NFI methodology is available here: https://bwi.info/Download/de/Methodik/. The timespan for the satellite observations is from July 2015 to October 2022 and BOA reflectance is labelled with tree species, diameter of the stem measured at a height of 1.3 m, height of the tree, area of the crown as projected to the ground, and additional variables. The dataset contains about 83 million data points from about 360.000 trees covering all environmental conditions in Germany. As reference for geolocation, the centre of the closest 1 km cell of the INSPIRE grid to the corresponding sampling unit of the NFI was used. The exact locations of the sampling units and individual tree positions are confidential. A short introduction on data access and analysis is provided in the Jupyter notebook (intro_to_dataset.ipynb) using Python.

Cadmium in Fischen aus der Nord- und Ostsee (2022)

Abstract:
Cadmium ist ein giftiges Schwermetall und weltweit verbreitet. Die Gehalte von Cadmium in Meeresfisch werden im Rahmen des Umwelt-Monitorings des Thünen-Instituts für Fischereiökologie regelmäßig überwacht, u.a. um regionale und zeitliche Unterschiede in der Kontamination zu erfassen. Die Ergebnisse fließen in nationale und europäische Umweltbewertungen ein. Die Daten sind Teil des Monitorings im Thünen-Institut für Fischereiökologie und sind als solche über die ICES-Datenbank Dome öffentlich zugänglich. Erläuterungen zu den ICES Codes in der angehängten Datei findet man hier: https://www.ices.dk/data/vocabularies/Pages/default.aspx
