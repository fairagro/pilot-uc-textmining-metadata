# Proposed return schemas for the RDI's
After the meta data is extracted from the text, they should be sent back to the RDI's so they can include them in their structured schemas. Here we include the proposed and (eventually) the final formats that should be forwarded to them.

## Folder Structure

The folder is divided as follows:

```bash
├── metadata_schemas
│   ├──openagrar   #Includes proposed schema for OpenAgrar
│   └──bonares     # Includes propose dschema for BonRes
```
